The news published on the date January 25, 2024 07:30 AM IST with headline  Is this the right time to rebalance your portfolio? is: 
 A balanced portfolio can potentially deliver better risk-adjusted returns, ensuring smoother sailing towards your financial destination. In 2023, Indian equity markets were the clear winner. The Nifty 100 index gave a return of around 18 percent, but mid-cap and small-cap indices gave returns of around 38 and 42 percent, respectively. On January 23, the S&P BSE Sensex tumbled by 1,000 points, or 1.47 percent. That's just a single day's fall. All these sharp movements, especially when markets rise the way they did in 2023, warrant a review, maybe rebalancing and shifting your asset allocation back to what is necessitated by your risk profiling and financial goals. Then, on days like January 23, when equity markets fall, your portfolio falls sharply. So, is it time to consider rebalancing your portfolio?Why rebalancing matters: Safeguarding your financial journeyStory continues below AdvertisementRemove AdRebalancing goes beyond mere adjustments in percentages; it's akin to recalibrating your financial compass. Here's why it's a crucial practice:Maintaining your risk compassAsset allocation is not a random number; it mirrors your unique risk tolerance. It draws the line between thrilling adventures and sleepless nights. A skewed portfolio tosses that line overboard, potentially exposing you to more risk than you bargained for. Rebalancing acts as a gentle tug back towards calmer waters, ensuring you stay true to your risk appetite and comfort level. It helps you reach your financial goals without unnecessary white-knuckle moments.

The Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund (PPFCF), the company’s flagship scheme, is the only actively managed scheme he holds. Appaiah has been an investor at PPFAS for the last six years. He says that all his money is in equities because he’s a central government employee, and a portion of his salary automatically gets invested in the National Pension Scheme. Since the NPS comes with a lock-in, Appaiah invests in equity funds to meet his liquidity needs.PPFAS MF is perhaps the only India-based fund house that calls its unitholders and opens itself up for questioning. It’s a rare opportunity for unitholders to meet their fund managers, and many investors didn’t miss the opportunity to click selfies with the management, particularly Rajeev Thakkar, the fund house’s Chief Investment Officer, Neil Parag Parikh, the Chief Executive Officer, and Raunak Onkar, Fund Manager, and Head-Research. The trio were joined on stage by Raj Mehta, Fund Manager, and Rukun Tarachandani, Fund Manager-Equity.The year 2023 has been good for the fund house, after a tough 2022. PPFCF has given a return of 30 percent so far this year, as against the category average of 20 percent, and its benchmark Nifty 500 index’s 17.5 percent returns. With assets of Rs 44,038 crore, PPFCF is now the second largest actively managed equity scheme in India. But does a large corpus make the fund sluggish?

 There has been a slew of portfolio management service (PMS) companies looking to enter the Rs 48 trillion Indian mutual fund industry. The capital market regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has proposed to introduce a new mutual fund (MF) that comes with high-risk, and offers a chance to earn higher returns. SEBI has sent a letter to Association of Mutual Funds of India (AMFI; the MF industry's trade body).Moneycontrol has reviewed this communication.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdSEBI initially put forth this proposal at a meeting with AMFI. Following which, it wrote a letter to AMFI to internally consult about the possibility of such a category. A person with knowledge of the matter said that SEBI is concerned that many investors- in the race to earn higher returns (out of greed)- rush to high-risk Portfolio Management Services and sometimes to unregistered advisors.Instead, he quoted SEBI's thinking- if mutual funds launch such a high risk product, then investors would more likely stay with mutual funds, which itself is tightly regulated by SEBI.According to people familiar with the matter, SEBI hasn't specified the instruments that this fund can invest in. "Matters are still at consultation stage," said this official. But MF industry officials say that such a scheme might be allowed to invest in instruments like momentum stocks (small-cap, mid-cap, micro-cap and mini-cap stocks), use derivative and high-risk leverage strategies.

At present, a quantitative model based on weighted average price-to-earnings ratio (PE ratio) of Nifty 50 index is employed. For example, if the ratio quotes below 12, then the fund managers will allocate 90-100 percent of the money to equities, if the ratio stands between 12 and 16, then 75-90 percent of the money will be invested in stocks. The model prescribes investing more in equity if the PE ratio is low and cut the exposure to equity if the ratio is high. If the PE ratio goes above 26 then only 30-40 percent of the money in equities.ALSO READ: RBI MPC: Das calls for greater transparency in floating-rate loans

Each mutual fund house issues a separate folio number. For subsequent investments, you are supposed to quote the same folio number if you want to keep your investment under one folio. Otherwise, a different folio number is issued.ALSO READ: FD rates for Senior Citizens: Banks that offer up to 9.1% interest on 3-year depositsNowadays, while creating new mutual fund folios, the fund house asks for KYC (know-your-client) details, contact details and nominations before allowing investments.

It also allowed daily SIP and STP (systematic transfer plan) facilities on any day. Earlier, the fund house used to offer a monthly SIP facility for any day from the 1st to 28th.

While these moves may take SIPs to more homes, the moot point is that such investments need to be regular and for a longer period.SIPs attract investorsMany mutual fund investors prefer to stagger their investments. The ‘invest as you earn’ method is convenient for most people. It also reduces the risk of timing the market. Over a long period of time, investors benefit from rupee-cost averaging. No wonder the amount of money deployed through SIPs is rising continuously. Investors put in Rs 14,749 crore through SIPs in mutual funds in May 2023, compared with Rs 12,286 crore in May 2022.

The news published on the date July 04, 2023 12:45 PM IST with headline  Smart investing: When exactly should you invest in a Focused Fund scheme? is: 
 Many investors look at focused funds as alternatives to PMS-style concentrated portfolio investing. The focused mutual fund scheme category, as the name suggests, has been mandated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to manage a concentrated portfolio consisting of a small number of stocks. A maximum of 30 stocks is allowed in a focused fund. This is much lower than that of categories like Flexicap, Largecap and Midcap Funds, which can have around 50-70 stocks.How do Focused funds stand up to Flexicap funds?Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdHowever, there are no restrictions on where the fund can invest (like in flexicap funds). Also, focused funds can allocate as much as they want to different market capitalisations and sectors. So, in essence, focused funds are like flexicap funds, but with a far more concentrated portfolio of a lesser number of stocks.Many investors look at focused funds as alternatives to PMS-style concentrated portfolio investing, given the low minimum investment requirement of focused funds compared to the Rs 50 lakh required for entry into PMS. But that is not a correct comparison. PMS is a different animal altogether in the way it is run by PMS managers. A better comparison would be the flexicap fund category.The rationale for focused funds is their potential to achieve better returns from investing in a concentrated portfolio by taking comparatively larger positions in high-conviction bets.

The second group rises from sales and marketing background. Who is better at heading a mutual fund house? The jury is still out. In this series of CEO profiles, we look at the successful fund managers who went on to head fund houses, later in their careers.Nilesh Shah’s humble beginnings in a middle-class neighbourhood, growing up in a 210 sq. ft. room in a chawl in Mumbai, as well as his single-minded focus on his education, would mould him and help him reap rich rewards later.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdIn 1997, just as he was about to join a large engineering company, a senior executive there advised him to join the financial markets. Shah then joined the ICICI group and was positioned in ICICI Securities. That was a stepping stone to him becoming one of India’s most successful fund managers. Today, Shah is the chief executive officer of Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co Ltd (AMC), which manages Rs 2.97 trillion of assets. Kotak Mahindra AMC is India’s fifth largest mutual fund (MF) house.He was the head of debt funds at Franklin Templeton India MF between 1997 and 2004. That was the golden age of debt funds, when debt funds outperformed equity funds, and Shah became a star fund manager. In 2002, Franklin India Corporate Debt Fund (Templeton India Income Fund, as it was known back then) gave an 18.3 percent return. Equity funds, on an average, gave 16.4 percent. Between January 2000 and June 2004, when interest rates fell from highs they would never again reach, his debt funds at Franklin Templeton gave a 12 percent return. Equity funds gave just 4.5 percent return in that period.When he joined ICICI Prudential AMC in 2004, the great Indian bull run began. The days of debt funds were over and equity funds staged a massive comeback. Shah took charge as the fund house’s chief investment officer just at the right time and oversaw debt as well as equity funds. He built a solid team of fund managers and research analysts.

 AMC stocks The introduction of the proposed fee caps for mutual fund schemes may potentially drive the profits of asset management companies (AMCs) down 30 percent.Larger AMCs may face an even greater impact, with profits taking up to a 50 percent dent. Lower fees imposed on larger funds could discourage consolidation and merger and acquisition (M&A) activities within the sector.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove Ad"Ceteris paribus, the impact on profit from change in equity-linked TER could be 30 percent of profit.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Here is how experts advise investors to go about investing in debt funds.Why the status quo?Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdMany experts had anticipated that the MPC meet will not tinker with the policy rates.RBI governor Shaktikanta Das made it clear that the focus on inflation targeting continues as the CPI inflation is projected at 5.1 percent for FY2023-24. This is above the target of 4 percent (within a band of +/- 2 percent) set by the RBI. The central bank has also reiterated that economic growth is on track. It forecast the real GDP growth for 2022-23 at 7.2 per cent and for 2023-2024 at 6.5 percent. The RBI has to target inflation at a time of strong domestic growth and weak global cues in the form of recessionary fears. The situation becomes further complicated due to early indications of El Nino – a weather condition wherein the distribution of monsoon may get adversely affected.ALSO READ: ESG or non-ESG funds: Which scheme to pick? | Simply Save

In October 2022, SEBI had issued an order wherein it found that the fund manager of the erstwhile Deutsche Mutual Fund and his parents had employed a scheme to 'front run' the orders of the fund house.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdNow typically, front-running and insider trading frauds are detected by stock market exchanges that use their surveillance systems in conjunction with SEBI. But with the proliferation of fund houses and brokerage houses over the years, this puts pressure on SEBI as well as the exchanges to constantly monitor and fish out culprits. By putting onus on the fund houses to put in place such systems, it wants fund houses to be more proactive.Additionally, SEBI also wants the chief executive officer (CEO) and chief compliance officer(CCO) to be made responsible for implementing these systems, so that the top management cannot escape accountability even if someone below commits the crime.A whistleblower policy is also sought to have been set up by SEBI. Infact by law, all listed fund houses are expected to have a whistleblower policy. But SEBI has now proposed that all fund houses, irrespective of being listed or not, must have a “vigil mechanism/ whistle blower policy as applicable to listed AMCs, which specifically addresses market abuse practices.”

 SEBI wants the CEO and chief compliance officer(CCO) to be made responsible for implementing survelillance systems, so that the top management cannot escape accountability even if someone below commits the crime. The capital markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), has proposed a drastic overhaul in the way mutual funds (MF) charge their expenses to customers. In a consultation paper issued recently, it simplified the definition of the total expense ratio (TER), yet made it much tighter by proposing that it include all peripheral expenses that fund houses were allowed to charge over and above the TER.This confirms an exclusive by Moneycontrol on January 28 that gave a glimpse of Sebi’s plans to cut down expense ratios.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdHere are the five big proposals and what they mean for you, the investor.TER must include brokerage expensesAt present, your equity fund can charge a maximum TER of 2 percent (for the first Rs 250 crore) to investors.

Conventional wisdom says that in order to achieve meaningful diversification, a portfolio of around 7-12 Mutual Funds (MF) is good enough. The flipside is that you may just find a lot of similar stocks across all your MF schemes.A typical large cap or flexi cap fund is seen holding anywhere between 35 and 50 stocks, a mid-cap fund could have 60 or more stocks and it’s not uncommon to find 80-100 or more stocks in a small cap fund.

 Globally, funds have followed either the symmetrical or the asymmetrical performance fee model. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is considering introducing a performance-based fee model for mutual funds (MFs) in India. The idea is to ensure that fund managers have more skin in the game. The idea of performance fees for MFs is not novel ― there are MFs in the US, the UK and other European countries, as well as in Asia and Australia that do offer such a fee model, but these are few and far between. Explaining why that is so, Feroze Azeez, Deputy Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Anand Rathi Wealth, says, “Globally, it’s not a big focus area, as it’s not easy for companies to operate mutual funds in this (performance-based fees) set-up. The revenue is uncertain whereas the costs are certain.”Apart from that, from the investors' perspective, the complexity of how the performance fee is calculated may deter investors from opting for it. Note that the performance fee model may be one option (in addition to a fixed fee option) and not the only one to be offered to investors.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdTalking about the UK market, Munish Randev, Founder & CEO, Cervin Family Office, says that performance-based fee model has not been popular for the mainstream MFs meant for retail investors. It is usually the higher-risk, concentrated portfolio kind of MF schemes that tend to offer this fee model.In a fixed-fee model, an asset management company (AMC) charges investors a certain management fee (fixed percentage) for managing their money ― this is irrespective of the fund performance. Under a performance-based fee model, in addition to the fixed percentage fee (which is set at a lower level), there is also a performance fee. This is charged as a certain percentage of the additional return over the fund benchmark over a specific period of time.

 Diversification across asset classes It's fun to try new food recipes sometimes, but you would agree with me that they can’t beat your mom’s time-tested classics. For instance, fusion foods like cheese-stuffed parathas are definitely delicious, but that’s not something you can eat every day for breakfast, unlike the simple yet delectable aloo paratha.A similar logic seems to apply to Indian investment portfolios. Most hybrid portfolios today, which are designed to benefit from a diversification strategy are allocated between equities and debt, leaving out the age-old investment asset class of gold. Like in other areas of life, we seem to be aping the West in the area of investing too.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdGold is…because rupee keeping depreciatingIf one stops to reflect as to why western portfolios don’t have active allocations to gold, one realises that, unlike in India, they don’t have secularly depreciating currencies that continue to deplete their purchasing power. And that’s the precise economic rationale for why gold has been a prominent part of our culture historically, in addition to being a lender of the last resort. Currency depreciation has worked in our favor when it comes to returns from gold. Debt, on the other hand, has been a reasonable diversifier to equities for the West, as it is comparatively less sensitive to market movements and less likely to incur losses, which highlights debt’s role more from a stability perspective and less from a diversifying downside risk perspective. Also, this argument recently got tested with higher interest rates spelling trouble for both these asset classes, making them move in tandem.If you check with your parents or grandparents, you will learn that gold was always a part of their investment plan, and it still is.

 With flexicap funds, one can diversify across companies with different market capitalisations. The two dominant categories of equity funds are largecap funds and flexicap funds. Most investor portfolios have at least one scheme from either category.But given the similarities in how, at times, both are managed by the same fund manager (more about similarities in a bit), is there really a case for having schemes from both categories in your portfolio?

 High or Low Duration: Which one will reward Fund managers of several dynamic bond funds (DBF) are busy raising the duration of their schemes in anticipation of rate cuts soon. However, a few are still not going all out for high duration portfolio strategy. Here is what you should know while investing in a DBF.The duration gameStory continues below AdvertisementRemove AdDuration measures how long it would take, in years, for an investor to be repaid a bond’s price by the bond’s total cash flows. Duration can also measure the sensitivity of a bond’s or fixed-income portfolio’s price to changes in interest rates. When interest rates fall, the higher a bond’s duration, the more its price will rise.Since DBFs allow maximum flexibility to the debt fund managers as they can decide on both the credit quality and the duration of the portfolio, these schemes can be actively managed depending on the view of the fund managers. Some fund managers actively change the duration of the scheme, whereas a few more choose less churn.Also, there are schemes such as Nippon Dynamic Bond Fund and Axis Dynamic Bond Fund which offer roll-down strategy. The roll-down strategy calls for investing in a basket of bonds that mature around a particular moment of time due to relative attractiveness at the time of investment and holding on to it till the maturity of those bonds. Even the interest receipts are invested accordingly.

 Debt Mutual Funds are attractive In the column on April 6 we looked at whether the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) rate hike cycle was coming to an end. In this backdrop, there are views in sections of the market that there would be a policy rate easing cycle ahead. It is an intellectual debate whether it is an RBI rate pause phase now or if rate cuts can be expected ahead. It depends on multiple variables, the major one being inflation.What we will discuss today is the related concepts of duration funds and duration call, if at all we expect rate cuts.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdHow interest rate movements impact your debt fundsIn fixed-income investments, the term duration has a different connotation from the general understanding of the word.The variability of the price of a bond or the NAV of a bond fund in response to interest changes in the market is proportional to the duration of the bond / bond fund. The longer the maturity / duration of the bond / bond fund, the higher the variability and vice versa. This variability works both ways. When interest rates are coming down and bond prices are moving up, a longer-duration bond benefits more than a shorter-duration one, for the same extent of market movement. On the other hand, when interest rates are going up and bond prices are coming down, the adverse impact is more on longer-duration bonds.

The reason why MC30 exists is to give you— our dear reader—a more manageable number of schemes (30) to choose from a large offering of more than 1,000 mutual fund (MF) schemes out there. Because all you need is about 7-12 MF schemes in your portfolio. MC30 schemes have a variety of actively-managed and passively-managed schemes, across categories. It is our endeavour to keep this basket as steady as possible.But over time, lots of things can change for an MF scheme. Sometimes, the fund manager’s calls go horribly wrong. Or worse, the after-effects of multiple such calls linger for way too long to ignore. A change in fund management also usually calls for a change of schemes in MC30, till the time we’re convinced there’ll be continuity in the way stocks have been picked. Or sometimes, there could just be better alternatives; the existing MC30 scheme may not be a bad one.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdWhatever be the reason, if new schemes come in, then an equal number of schemes go out.

 SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans) continue to be a popular investment method among retail investors.

 SIP in debt mutual fund scheme This might come as a bit of a surprise, especially for debt fund investors. Just last month, the finance ministry abolished the long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax benefits, and indexation benefits.Despite this, debt funds are still a good option to invest. And there are few reasons. Unlike the FD taxation where interest is taxed each year, the tax liability in debt funds arises only at redemption. So you can defer (capital gains) tax liabilities for years and allow more of your invested money to compound. If that is not enough, then you can also adjust capital losses from other investments against the capital gains from debt funds.

As the capital gains on debt funds units purchased after April 1, 2023, become taxable at the slab rate, many investors would think that debt funds come at par with fixed deposits. However, it is not the case. A careful look at both these instruments will help you to choose the right one to reach your financial goals.ReturnsStory continues below AdvertisementRemove AdThe returns on FDs are assured, and so it is with bonds. Anup Bhaiya, Founder of Mumbai-based Money Honey Financial Services, says, “Repricing of interest rates gets captured in debt funds faster, as bond yields in the secondary market tend to react to changes in interest rates in the economy quickly. The interest rates on FDs generally act with a lag.”Debt funds do not offer assured returns. Market forces, changes in interest rates, changes in portfolio mix by the fund manager, and other factors can change the returns on debt funds. For example, long-duration debt funds may see returns going up when there is a big fall in interest rates in a short span of time. The capital gains on bonds held in the portfolio can boost returns. In a rising interest-rate scenario, such schemes may see muted returns.ALSO READ: 7 changes in financial landscape you need to know this April

 The government’s direct tax proposals meant foregoing revenue of an estimated Rs 38000 crore at the gross level. For long, the tax efficiency of debt funds was tom-tommed rather than the returns they fetched. The tax arbitrage was so stark that fund managers highlighted this point more than their ability to generate alpha.After the March 24 amendment to the Finance Bill, all that remains in favour of debt mutual funds is that they will enjoy deferred taxation compared to fixed deposits (FD). In an FD, one pays tax on accrual, whether or not the FD is redeemed. With mutual funds, tax will be applicable on redemption, whenever that happens.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdHypothetically, if you invest and not redeem your MF for the next 10 years, you will manage to defer your tax liability for that period.What happens to target maturity funds?Target Maturity Funds (TMF) are the newest kid on the block, and many fund houses have launched them in the past few months given that interest rates are at a high, and unlikely to go up much — if at all — from these levels. For those open to locking away their money for 3-5 years, TMFs provided an excellent opportunity.

It’s also important to top-up your SIPs, periodically. If you were, say, doing Rs 100 SIP (a month) till about a year back, we have been advising that you should increase it to Rs 110, to Rs 120, to Rs 130. Almost every six months, you can keep increasing the SIP if the Nifty remains in the 17,000 to 18,000 levels.And if it falls to around 16,000 levels, maybe you can even put up a lump sum amount as well.

The new fund offer (NFO) opened on February 20, 2023.What is on offer?Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdSDF’s objective is to build a diversified portfolio of dividend-paying stocks. The scheme is managed by Rohit Shimpi and the performance of the scheme is benchmarked against the Nifty 500 TRI. The fund manager has to invest a minimum 65 percent of the money in dividend-paying companies. The scheme plans to build the portfolio in such a manner that the overall dividend yield of the portfolio is at least 50 percent more than that offered by Nifty50.What works?The dividend-yield strategy has been around for some time. For beginners, the dividend yield is computed by dividend per share by price per share. So, if a share with a price of Rs 100 pays out a dividend of Rs 4, the dividend yield works out to 4 percent. Higher the dividend yield of a stock, the more attractively valued it is, says old wisdom.

 It is pouring new fund offers (NFO) of target maturity funds (TMF) on mutual fund (MF) street. As many as 10 NFOs are on at the moment, as per data available with Value Research, that would mature as distant as in the year 2033. It appears that the year’s first monetary policy review by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on February 8 has not tempted fund houses to hold on for a little longer.That’s both, good and bad news for investors.

Your scheme’s portfolio composition is the next deciding factor.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdBut the question is: Should you wait for the RBI policy to pass and then perhaps wait for a few more days to see where bond yields are headed?Can Feb 8 RBI policy make any difference?As interest rates are nearing their peak, it could be the right time to lock in yields. A Balasubramanian, Managing Director & CEO, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, expects a 25-basis- point (bps) rate hike in the upcoming monetary policy review. “As the risks from the external front and inflation have subsided recently, RBI can shift its focus back on “growth”. Beyond rate hikes, liquidity will be used as an active policy tool for 2023, and will be a larger driver of broad interest rate movement incrementally,” he said. A 25-bps increase will push the repo rate to 6.5 percent, which should be the terminal rate for the current rate cycle. “RBI should pause thereafter,” he added.

 Fixed income is an attractive asset class Bonds had a challenging 2022 with the widely used bond benchmark - Crisil Composite Bond Index - up only by about 3 percent, underperforming other major asset classes - gold (about 14 percent), equities (6 percent) and cash (5 percent).Bond yields rose to multi-year highs in 2022, as the RBI raised policy rates by 225 bps to 6.25 percent. The RBI along with other major global central banks tried to burnish its inflation-fighting credentials by signalling an aggressive pace of rate hikes, indicating its willingness to sacrifice growth to sustainably bring down inflation from multi-decade highs, leading to a spike in domestic and global bond yields. Bond gains were muted across major bond mutual fund categories with gilt funds, long-term duration funds and medium-term duration funds lagging other bond categories.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdThe worst may be behind for bond marketsOver the course of 2022, continued upward shifts in the market’s expectation of central banks’ terminal or peak policy rates given persistent and elevated inflationary pressures, was a key headwind for bonds. The global macroeconomic backdrop for 2023 is likely to be challenging. One of the fastest Fed interest rate hiking cycles on record makes a US economic recession very likely. We also expect a recession in Europe due to the energy price shock. An economic slowdown should help inflation cool significantly but not all the way back to the 2 percent target of the US Fed.In our assessment, India’s growth-inflation dynamics is stable and better than its peers. The post-pandemic economic recovery cycle remains strong amid supportive government policies and a pick-up in investments. Further, the likely broadening of the economic recovery to the rural economy and service sectors is a strong tailwind.
 
The news published on the date February 06, 2023 03:33 PM IST with headline  Opinion: 5 reasons why Budget 2023 will push India’s growth story, despite global gloom is: 
 Trideep Bhattacharya, CIO-Equities, Edelweiss AMC The Union Budget ahead of elections is always an event for financial markets, which fear that the finance minister may choose to go for populist announcements, and fiscal prudence may take a back seat. However, the Budget 2023 presented by Nirmala Sitharaman has been a landmark one which remained prudent but also paved the path for strong economic growth in the near future. And there are reasons to believe that this ‘Panchamrit’ Budget, though appears a non-event in terms of the absence of big-bang announcements, will go a long way as a propeller of India’s growth story. Let us understand five key enablers of the Union Budget 2023:Increased focus on capital creationStory continues below AdvertisementRemove AdCapital expenditure, a key variable tracked in a growth economy, is proposed at 3.3 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product, or at Rs 10 lakh crore. Just to put it in context, this is three times what was allocated for capital expenditure in FY2019-2020. The Indian government’s policy response to the economic slowdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic was centred on public expenditure. And this year’s 33 percent increase indicates better times ahead for infrastructure, capital goods, Railways and defence sectors in India.Increased focus on a housing recoveryHousing is an allied sector of core infrastructure in India. It also is a key employment generator. The Budget proposes higher allocation towards affordable housing compared to the last couple of years. This will be a big positive for housing finance companies, and other companies that directly or indirectly benefit from the expected boom phase in real estate.
 
The news published on the date February 03, 2023 07:16 AM IST with headline  Mutual Funds: Why investing in last year’s winner may prove to be a dud is: 
 Picking the best fund is a tough task If you look at the returns of equity mutual funds (MF) over the past several years, you will find one thing — no one fund will be among the top year after year. That is reasonably good proof for the oft-repeated disclaimer: “Past performance is no guarantee of future results.”But the fact is that investors chase performance. In any given year, the people who need to pick a fund will quite often pick schemes based on the past year’s returns, or look for schemes which are the table-toppers. They feel that if something has done well last year, it is bound to do well the next few years as well. But that is far from the truth. It is statistically impossible for a scheme (in a given fund category) to be the top performer of the category across market cycles and for several years continuously.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdI have come across people who start a 12-month SIP in a fund which has done the best in the past one year. After a year, once the SIP stops, they again pick another fund which did the best the following year and start a new SIP. This is unwise. Fund selection should never be based solely on near-term performance. There have been many instances where a fund that was in the bottom 10 percent in one year shot up to the top 10 percent the next. There have been several cases of the reverse too.Don’t just rely on past performanceSo, if you shouldn’t pick funds just based on past performance, then how to shortlist funds for your portfolio?

 Economic Survey 2023, the prelude to the budget, had already shown glimpses of the health of the economy with Gross Domestic Product growth this financial year pegged at around 6.5-7 percent and for FY 24 at 6.5 percent on domestic demand revival and an uptick in capital expenditure.It had been expected that the Budget for FY 24 will lean towards rewarding taxpayers and it did so.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdThe personal income tax announcements are indicative of the government's push towards the tax paying citizen to opt for the new tax regime announced in FY 20-21. This regime has now become the default regime and the new slabs are to nudge taxpayers to opt for it. The highest income tax rate has also been reduced to 39 percent (previously 42.74 percent).This means both small and high-income group taxpayers have some more cash at disposal at the expense of tax sops. This is a significant change from earlier regimes, investors would now have to plan for their finances for both short-term and long-term goals.They will have to own their financial independence and start investing across financial products. Hopefully this would bring more investors to the capital markets; this will also benefit economy at large and would result in more discretionary spending.

Every day, there is news of some bank or the other increasing FD rates. Many large private banks now offer about 7 percent on one-year FDs.If we compare this with the average debt fund returns of various categories over the past 1-2 years, it’s natural for many savers to feel they should just stick to good old bank FDs. But it is not the correct approach. I will explain why.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdThe RBI has been hiking interest rates to tame inflation. When policy interest (repo) rates rise, bond prices fall because they are inversely related. As a result, the net asset values (NAV) of debt funds holding bonds also fall. As NAV falls, past returns naturally start looking poor as of today.However, there is a positive effect as well when interest rates are increased – not immediately, but over the next few months/quarters. And the positive here is that the YTM (yield-to-maturity) of these bonds starts rising. This means that potential returns start going up.Will debt funds continue to be in a slump?

 Systematic investment plans (SIPs) have emerged as a popular means to invest in mutual funds, especially equity funds. In November 2022, a sum of Rs 13,306 crore was invested through 6.04 crore SIP accounts in various mutual funds schemes. While it is a significant number, many investors see their investment plans suffer when some of their SIP mandates do not go through due to insufficient funds in the bank account.SIP cancellationsStory continues below AdvertisementRemove AdMost investors look at SIP as a tool to invest for the long term and build wealth over a long period of time. However, there are situations which lead to cancellations of the SIP. The reasons could be loss of income, poor performance of schemes and changed financial goals among others.When the fund house presents the SIP debit mandate to the bank of the investor, the funds get transferred from the bank account of the investor to the bank account of the mutual fund house. However, when such debit mandates fail due to a lack of sufficient funds in the bank account of the investor, the units are not allotted to the investor. It is an industry-wide practice that if three consecutive SIP debits are not honoured due to a lack of sufficient funds, then the SIP stands cancelled. In a recent addendum issued by PGIM India Mutual Fund, the fund house made it clear that four consecutive failures of SIP due to a lack of funds in the bank account of the investor will lead to SIP cancellation.“Earlier the SIP used to get cancelled after three continuous dishonours, which has been now revised to four. This is more favourable to the investor as it gives the investor one additional month,” said a spokesperson from PGIM India Mutual Fund.

 Representative image The Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in a bid to protect the investors’ interest dealing in units of direct plans of mutual fund schemes, announced the introduction of the regulatory framework for the execution-only platform (EOP) for direct mutual fund schemes. The announcement comes after the meeting of the board of directors of SEBI today. In August 2022, the regulator had sought feedback on the regulatory framework for transaction-only platforms, which allow transactions in mutual funds without the help of mutual fund distributors.The regulator made it clear that the detailed framework and the modalities of the implementation of the EOP regulations, nature of services that may be offered by the EOPs, cyber security requirements, pricing of services, and grievances redressal mechanisms will be announced later through circulars.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdThe EOP for direct plans of mutual funds has three key objectives. First is to offer convenience to the investors in making investments through EOPs, and second is to put in place an appropriate investors protection mechanism. The third objective is to ensure ease of doing business with the EOPs by mandating only such appropriate regulatory compliances that are required for execution services. This should reduce the regulatory and compliance burden on such platforms.“Under the approved framework, EOPs may be granted registrations under either of the two categories – Category 1 EOP as an agent of AMCs, registered with AMFI or category 2 EOP, as an agent of investor, registered as a stockbroker,” the press release said.As of now many entities offering direct plans on their investment platforms are registered as stock brokers. The industry observers say that many of them would like to continue as Category 2 EOPs, as agent investors and registered as a stock broker. Since these entities are used to collect fees from the clients on an ongoing basis and there are agreements in place to that effect, they may find it easy to continue as it is.

Both schemes will be investing in long-term government securities (G-Secs). These schemes will buy and hold on to the bonds they invest in. In mutual fund (MF) parlance, this is known as roll-down strategy. The idea is to keep earning interest without taking much credit risk. For investors looking at long-term investments in bonds, this can be an attractive investment option. The fund house collects the coupon and keep investing it in bonds of similar maturities.

The news published on the date December 07, 2022 03:01 PM IST with headline  How should debt fund investors play the RBI rate hike? is: 
 The Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has continued with its rate hiking spree as it increased the policy repo rate by 35 basis points to 6.25 percent. The increase, in line with analyst views, has also raised expectations of the interest rate hiking cycle coming to an end soon. Against this backdrop, the investment strategies for debt investors need to be carefully reviewed. Here is what experts have to say.Have the rates peaked?Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdIf you have been investing in any fixed-income product that offers a market-determined rate of return, then this is the most worrying part of the investment puzzle. In most of the key economies, including the US, interest rates have been hiked by central bankers. Since May 2022, the RBI too has increased policy rates by 190 basis points to contain inflation. Hence, today's 35 basis-point rate hike is no surprise and was moreover discounted by the market participants. Though some investors have started to believe that we are nearing the end of the rate hike curve, do not make the mistake to think that rates will soon start coming down.The quantum and pace of further rate hikes will be dependent on how the macroeconomic environment will shape up. “Headline inflation is expected to remain above or close to the upper threshold in Q3 and Q4:2022-23. It is likely to moderate in H1:2023-24 but will still remain well above the target. Meanwhile, economic activity has held up well and is expected to be resilient, supported by domestic demand. Net exports would remain subdued due to the drag from evolving external demand conditions. Further, the impact of monetary policy measures undertaken needs to be watched,” states the monetary policy statement issued today.Simply put, investors have to keep a track of macroeconomic factors, both domestic as well as global, to get an idea of where the interest rates are headed. The Union Budget 2023 will also be a key event that will offer much-needed information pertaining to fiscal deficit and government borrowings.
 
The news published on the date December 07, 2022 02:02 PM IST with headline  RBI hikes interest rate as expected, and keeps the door open for further hikes is: 
 Even as the Reserve Bank of India governor appeared on television screens on Wednesday morning, most people in the market were expecting an interest rate hike of 35 basis points (bps), i.e., 0.35 percent point. And this is just what happened. The interest rate increase we are talking about is on the repo rate, the rate at which the RBI lends funds to banks, if required, one day at a time. It went up from 5.9 per cent to 6.25 per cent. This rate is the pivot for interest rates in the entire economy. A hike in the repo rate today increases banks’ lending and deposit rates tomorrow. People’s antennae were up for a gauge on future rate hikes—whether there is any hint or softening of the stance—to gauge how the RBI would act at its next meeting on February 8, 2023. And the RBI kept its options open. If required, it will go in for another rate hike of, say, 25 bps.Having said that, things can change over the next two months. There would be two more data points on inflation, that of November, to be declared in a few days from now and that of December, to be announced in January 2023. If inflation is on the higher side of expectations, that may be a case for another rate hike. There is a meeting of the Federal Reserve scheduled on December 14, where the US central bank is expected to hike the interest rate by 50 bps. This is known to markets and the RBI. What will be of relevance is the Fed’s outlook on future interest rate action. Global developments on geopolitical tensions, crude oil price (which has a big bearing on our inflation) and other prices would pan out over next two months. Moreover, the Union budget will be announced on February 1, 2023, i.e., just prior to the next RBI meeting on February 8. The extent of fiscal deficit announced in the budget and whether it is overall pro- or anti-inflationary would influence the RBI’s deliberations.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdOther aspects of the reviewIn Wednesday’s policy review, the other variables that financial market participants would look at are inflation and GDP growth. The RBI’s projection on Consumer Price Index or CPI inflation remains similar to that of the previous policy review, which is 6.7 percent in 2022-23 and expected to ease to 5 percent in the first quarter of 2023-24. There is a minor upward tweak in inflation projections, in decimal points only. GDP growth projection for the current year, 2022-23, was revised downward from 7 percent earlier to 6.8 percent. A downward revision in growth projections implies the need for support from the RBI in terms of not-so-high interest rates. However, inflation is the bigger consideration for the central bank when it comes to interest rate decisions.Market reaction

The general feeling is that it is high time that the finance minister raises the quantum of deduction.“The dated threshold to avail deductions under Section 80C must be revised. There is a sense of urgency attached to this revision considering growing incomes, ability to financialise savings and the economic need to route savings to investments,” says Nirav Karkera, head, research, Fisdom, a financial advisory firm.

A good course from a good college can set a child’s career on the right track.While there are several investment options available to secure your children’s future, these are the top three:· Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY): for daughters only.· Equity mutual funds (MF): for both sons and daughters.· Public Provident Fund (PPF): for both sons and daughters.SSY and PPFSince both are debt instruments, we will discuss them together (though Sukanya Samriddhi is only available for daughters).When it comes to interest rates, SSY is better at 7.6 percent vs. PPF at 7.1 percent. But that shouldn’t be the only reason to pick SSY over PPF.Also read | Last minute tax-planning tipsAn SSY account can be opened for a girl child up to the age 10. It has a 21-year tenure (or it will close post her wedding). Deposits can be made till the 15th year. The SSY corpus will still generate returns from the 16th to the 21st year. One cannot make any additional contributions from the 16th to the 21st year.The entire SSY corpus is locked-in till the girl child attains the age of 18. Thereafter, only up to 50 percent of the amount can be withdrawn for educational needs. Hence, liquidity may be an issue. What if your daughter’s higher education requires more money than the available 50 percent of the SSY corpus? You have more lying there but it’s not available at your time of need.Also read | Should you invest in children-specific mutual fund schemes?Nonetheless, there is some merit in SSY, and it gives better tax-free returns. But if liquidity after the 15th year is a concern, then having a PPF account is also advisable, as one can withdraw funds from one’s PPF account after 15 years. PPF provides greater flexibility and can be used as an investment tool even after the daughter’s marriage or the closure of her SSY account.Equity MFsBut neither PPF nor SSY are the best options if your daughter’s higher education goals are several years away. Why?Also read | High on returns, low on volatility: These mutual funds offer a winning comboThat’s because both PPF and Sukanya are long-tenure debt products. Given the high cost of education and the inflation these days, it’s possible that the savings in SSY and PPF alone will be unable to match the pace of inflation. The result will be inadequate savings. And that is something that you would never want as a parent.Also read | Zerodha's Nithin Kamath, who started trading at 17, has this to advice to young kidsSound investment logic demands that when investing for long-term goals, it’s better to invest more in equity as that is the only viable option to generate inflation-beating returns in the long term. Doing so through a disciplined SIP (systematic investment plan) in equity funds is your best bet.How to split your money between MFs, SSY and PPF?Here are a few thumb rules to follow:· If you are ultra-conservative and the goals are 15-plus years away, then keep it simple and give your 100 percent to SSY and PPF.· If your children are older, the long lock-in periods of SSY and PPF may not align with your goal requirements. In that case, you can pick a few debt MFs.· If you have a moderate risk appetite, then allocate 50 percent to equity MFs, and split the remaining 50 percent between SSY and / or PPF.· For moderately aggressive to aggressive investors, it can be 80-100 percent in equity funds, and the remaining (if any) in SSY / PPF.If you are looking for some real numbers to suggest how much to invest, below are a few:· If you need to accumulate Rs 75 lakh in 15 years, then invest Rs 18,000-19,000 per month in an 80:20 equity MF:debt split.· If you need to accumulate Rs 50 lakh in 10 years, then invest Rs 24,000-25,000 per month in a 65:35 equity MF:debt allocation.· If you need to accumulate Rs 35 lakh in 6 years, then invest Rs 36,000-37,000 per month in 40:60 MF:debt allocation.Also read | Thus, the earlier you start, the better it is. For instance, if your target is to reach Rs 50 lakh in 10 years then you need to invest Rs 24,000-25,000 monthly at a roughly 65:35 MF:debt split. But if you start earlier and have 15 years to reach the same goal, then you only need to invest Rs 12,000-13,000 per month.Insurance is also importantBut just investing adequately every month is not enough, if god forbid something were to happen to you. Make sure you buy a large term life insurance cover that provides enough money not only for your children’s higher education and marriage, but for regular household expenses as well (if you are the sole-earner), children’s school expenses and other goals like a house purchase, etc

 Yesterday, Edelweiss Mutual Fund, India’s 13th largest fund house with assets of just under Rs 90,000 crore, launched the Edelweiss Nifty Midcap 150 Momentum 50 Index Fund (ENM50). This was one among three passive equity schemes of the fund house. ENM50 is also the 21st smart-beta fund to be launched by the Rs 40 trillion Indian mutual fund (MF) industry this year. The fund will invest in a basket of 50 stocks, drawn from the Nifty Midcap 150 index.Overall, the Indian MF industry now has 35 smart-beta schemes with assets under management (AUM) of at least Rs 2,700 crore as on October 2022-end. The concept is relatively new in the Indian equity investment space, but garnering popular interest very fast. 21 of 35 smart-beta funds were launched in the last one year itself; the collective AUM of these 21 funds is around Rs 787 crore.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdAn ETF or exchange traded fund is a way of investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks that mirrors an underlying market capitalisation-based index like the Nifty 50 or Nifty 100. What you get are quality stocks in a diversified portfolio at a low cost because there is no active fund manager involved.A smart-beta ETF goes a step further and filters stocks from an index to deliver attributes that suit you best. It’s often referred to as an active strategy within a passive structure. This can also be done through an index fund wrapper, where the fund invests in relevant ETFs instead of specific stocks.Last year around this time, when there were about 13 such schemes already in existence, Moneycontrol had advised a wait-and-watch approach before investing in what was clearly becoming a fad. Has anything changed since? Let’s see.

Many retail investors wrongly consider mutual funds (MFs) with lower net asset values (NAVs) to be cheaper. This misconception is often used by many to promote new fund offers (NFOs) as their units are issued at a face value of Rs 10.However, multiple factors determine the NAV of any MF. For example, as the NAV of a fund is determined on the basis of the market value of its constituent investments, a well-managed fund’s NAV can grow faster than that of other funds, leading it to register higher NAV over the period.

 Investing abroad has picked up in the last few years. For years, Indian investors have been obsessed over how much money foreigners bring into Indian markets. Now Indians have also increasingly started to invest abroad.As per data by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Indians invested $19,611 million in 2021-22, up from $12,684 million a year before that. Smart investors have been investing a part of their money abroad for better diversification for quite some time, taking benefit of the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) of the Indian government, which allows every resident Indian individual to send $2,50,000 abroad per financial year. Over time, the RBI has increased this limit. When the scheme was started in 2004, it was just $25,000.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdTraditionally, mutual funds have been offering international equities, particular US equities, to Indian investors. But Covid-19 has accelerated this pace. The strong recovery of the global stock markets, post the onset of the global Covid-19 pandemic, mainly due to the government money pumped in to support economies, found its way to the stock markets. Markets indices and several sectors, particularly the Information Technology sector stocks, picked up, on account of companies investing in technology to support work-from-home. In 2021-22 alone, Indians invested $747 million in international equity and debt investments, up from $472 million a year before.But there are many other reasons for Indians to send money abroad. Aside from investments, the LRS allows you to send money for travel, holidays, medical treatment, gifts, donations, funding foreign studies and even buying property. In 2021-22, Indians bought property worth $113 million. From London to Dubai and New York and the Caribbean, Indian are buying residencies abroad. Experts say that attractive yields and the potential for capital appreciation are just one reason. But the ease of getting permanent residencies on the condition that you invest a sum of money abroad buying property is also an offer many rich Indians cannot resist.For those who don’t wish the hassle of investing in physical property, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT) offer a slice of foreign property.

Funds raised going back three years need to be disclosed. This is significant after the losses investors made on recent IPOs by start-ups that raised questions about their valuations.Impact: The additional disclosures will enable investors to make an informed decision on whether to participate in an IPO or not. This also makes IPO managers accountable in explaining on how valuations are arrived at by giving a historic comparison of valuations. Start-ups will find it easier to convince investors of their potential because they would be able to put forth the unique parameters that are more representative of their business beyond traditional metrics.Fund manager under the radar

Although it doesn’t have such restrictions for MF units, it stops employees from selling schemes in case certain events are likely to occur.

The reason is not that people do not understand its importance; rather, they don’t know the exact math behind it.Diversification means spreading your investments across instruments to minimise the risk. But what combination of instruments will achieve the result, is sometimes hard to figure out.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdFor instance, buying shares of 10 different companies will help you minimise company-specific risks. But if these 10 shares belong to the same sector, you’ll expose your portfolio to sector-specific risks. And that’s precisely why this is not called optimal diversification.This mostly happens when investors try to create a mutual fund portfolio. We believe that schemes with different names or different categories have disparate strategies, but this is not always the case.

Global supply chain, too, continued to be disrupted mainly because of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and fresh outbreak of Covid-19 in China and subsequent restrictions imposed on movement. Domestic equity market too has been a victim of these eventualities.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdInflation: The Biggest Concern for the MarketsInflation continued to hog the limelight and remained the biggest concern for economists and central banks the world over. There is, however, a feeling in some circles that the inflation might be on its way to peaking out sooner, rather than later, and that will give some comfort to the central banks to reconsider their aggressive stance towards interest rate hikes. Controlling inflation takes a toll on the economic growth which, in turn, affects the whole gamut of macro and micro factors that affect the global population.“With actions from various global economies and from the Indian government, we feel that the inflation will start easing in the coming quarters as the international crude prices are already below $100 a barrel, which is a positive for the importing country like India,” said Rajnath Yadav, Research Analyst at Choice Broking. This is one of the key reasons for the recent optimism in the domestic markets. “However, we believe this momentum is short-lived,” Yadav said.

 Asset management companies added 51 lakh investor accounts in June quarter, taking the total tally to 13.46 crore, on increasing awareness about mutual funds and ease of transactions through digitisation, and experts hope the ongoing financial year to be promising too.

The news published on the date July 06, 2022 04:40 PM IST with headline  Mutual Funds | There’s no conflict between Sharpe Ratio and Treynor Ratio is: 
 (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Risk and return are two dimensions of investment performance. Investors tend to focus on return, with little regard to the risk involved, while they should look at the risks along with the return. There are many risk-adjusted return ratios, and their performance measures assess the performance of investments in terms of return per unit of risk.Mutual funds periodically communicate their performance in a document called factsheet. There are a few fund tracking entities providing such information as well. In a typical mutual fund factsheet, investors see return disclosed for different periods of times i.e. since the inception of the fund, last 10 years, last five years, last three years, last one year, etc.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdFactsheets also provide information of various measures of risk such as standard deviation and Beta. Standard deviation is a measure of the total risk, while Beta is a measure of market risk. In addition to return and risk, factsheets provide information of some risk-adjusted return measures such as Sharpe Ratio and Treynor Ratio. These risk-adjusted performance measures assess the performance of a fund in terms of return per unit of risk.Sharpe Ratio calculates the fund’s return in excess of the risk-free return and divides the excess return by the portfolio’s standard deviation. The Sharpe Ratio is a measure of relative performance. It enables investors to compare across investment opportunities. Higher the Sharpe Ratio, better is the ‘Reward to Variability’. A fund with a higher Sharpe Ratio in relation to another is preferable as it indicates that the fund has generated better return for every unit of risk.Treynor Ratio is computed by dividing a portfolio's excess return, by its Beta. Like Sharpe Ratio, it is a measure of relative performance. The Treynor Ratio is also known as the reward-to-volatility ratio.

The news published on the date June 30, 2022 08:13 AM IST with headline  July 1: New rules to invest in mutual funds, teething troubles initially, but a safer future is: 
 From July 1, mutual fund investments cannot be initiated from a pool account. The money has to go from the investor’s bank account to the bank account of the mutual fund house, as mandated by regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). All transaction platforms backed by stock exchanges will implement this, which may see some teething troubles for investors as well as other stakeholders.All non-exchange transaction platforms including MF Utility have already implemented it since June 1, of course with some glitches. But the situation is improving gradually and may become error-free as all stakeholders catch up with the new operations rigmarole.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdWhat went wrong earlier?Mutual fund investors and distributors have been vocal about issues such as delayed confirmations about allotment of units, inability to pay using cheque, RTGS and NEFT, and failed SIP transactions, among others.As the money moves from investor to the fund house, the transaction platforms have to rely on the payment processing entity for the details such as actual credit of money in a mutual fund’s bank account and the source of funds. Investors are allotted units only when the fund house receives the money. Also, the source of the money so received needs to be verified as being from the investor’s bank account, as mutual fund houses do not accept third-party payments. Put simply, third-party payments are those which do not originate from the bank account of the investor. These issues have led to delayed confirmation of allotment of units. However, MF Utilities—an industry-promoted, widely used platform for transacting units—has clarified that the Registrars and transfer agents systems are ramped up and the situation has improved. It added that there is no delay in allotment of units where rules are complied with. Channel checks with distributors indicate that the delay in confirmation of transactions of up to six days earlier this month has come down to a day or two.

The news published on the date June 28, 2022 09:06 AM IST with headline  Why your mutual fund’s CAGR return may hide its true performance is: 
 Say you start with an investment of Rs 1 lakh today. After a year, it grows by 100 percent and your investment becomes Rs 2 lakh. Sadly, in the second year, your investment falls by half; Rs 2 lakh becomes Rs 1 lakh. How much is your return?Your average return in this period may be an arithmetic mean of +100% and -50%, which is 25 percent. But the CAGR of the portfolio will be 0 percent as the portfolio did not make any money in two 2 years. And this is the right conclusion. You started with Rs 1 lakh and after 2 years, you are still at Rs 1 lakh.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdBut as you may have noticed, CAGR hides a lot. It never gives you the complete picture.CAGR hides volatilityTake for example an investment where your money experiences an annual return sequence of +12%, +2%, +49%, (-)19% and +28%. The final CAGR over 5-year period will be around 12%. So CAGR actually hides the volatility in the period under consideration (where your investment moved up +49% and also fell by -19%) to deliver a smooth-looking number (12% in this case).

Fund houses would stipulate the minimum tenure of the SIP to be eligible for this benefit, typically around three years and the sum assured would range between 100 and 120 times of the SIP amount.Some fund houses used to offer target sum assured which would reduce the death benefit as SIP instalments come in. Target sum assured at the beginning of the SIP would be equal to SIP amount and the number of instalments one wants to invest. In most cases, SIP in equity and hybrid schemes were eligible for insurance benefits.The cover would cease by the age of 55 years of the investor, or as SIP matures or if the SIP gets cancelled for any reason by the investor, whichever is earlier. In most cases, the insurance would kick in immediately after signing up for an SIP. And the only exclusion was suicide in the first year of SIP.

The news published on the date May 30, 2022 08:25 AM IST with headline  Fixed-income investments becoming attractive again is: 
 Representative image. There is setback in the world of investments. Equity markets are volatile, bond interest rates are moving up, gold is not shining, crypto coins are vanishing.In fixed-income investments, however, there is a one-to-one correspondence between interest rates going up in marked-to-market products and your accrual level moving up. To illustrate this, in debt mutual fund schemes, Net Asset Value (NAV) is computed every day, which is done at the valuation yield level of that day. Yield levels or interest rates have been moving up for some time and since yield and bond price moves inversely, the valuation prices are coming down.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdOver a period of time, this drives up the accrual level of your portfolio. How does that happen? When the bond matures, it happens at face value. Since valuation was happening at a little lower level, it gives a kicker on maturity. Then, the proceeds are invested at a higher yield (i.e. interest) level. Moreover, when the fund gets fresh money, it is invested at a higher yield level than earlier. Net-net, returns from debt mutual funds have been muted for some time, but in the process, the accrual level has been moving up, which makes it relatively that much attractive.How to gauge this level of attractiveness, which we are stating is better than earlier? It is the portfolio yield level, which is the Yield-To-Maturity (YTM) data available on the factsheet of any debt fund, which is the nearest available proxy. You can compare the yield level of debt funds today with that of say one year ago, and you can spot the difference.Let us take an illustration of how much return you can expect, now onwards, based on portfolio YTM or net of fund-recurring-expenses YTM. The appropriate fund category to look at is Target Maturity Funds (TMFs). The reason is, in the usual open-ended funds, market movement of yield levels will influence your returns, either on the positive side (favourable to you) or on the negative side. TMFs also are open-ended funds, but here, provided you hold on till maturity, impact of market movement would be negligible. TMFs are available in various maturities, from 1 year to 10 years.

 When it comes to parking funds for the short term, the average investor prefers liquid, overnight or ultra-short-term funds. However, of late some investors are looking at arbitrage funds, given equity taxation and exposure to money market yield. Though it can improve post-tax returns, the volatility involved in such investments cannot be ignored.Arbitrage funds for short termStory continues below AdvertisementRemove AdArbitrage funds look to capture the difference in price in the spot market and that in the futures market. If a stock quotes at Rs 100 in the spot market and the same trades at Rs 100.50 in futures, then the fund manager looks to buy it in the spot market and simultaneously sell it in the futures market. By the time of expiry the prices converge and the fund manager reverses the transaction and pockets the price differential (technically known as spot future spread) minus transaction costs. The idea is to avoid stock market risk and focus on the arbitrage—the price differential. Arbitrage funds have given 3.49 percent returns over the year ended May 20, according to Value Research.Though these schemes work better for an investor with a minimum timeframe of one year, many are looking at it for the very short term, typically up to three months. Monthly data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India also shows sizeable redemptions at the end of each quarter, just like other short-term-focused products such as liquid, ultra-short debt funds. Arbitrage funds saw net redemptions of Rs 4,303 crore and Rs 6,796 crore in December 2021 and March 2022.Volatility in returns

 We conducted an employee investor awareness programme for a corporate recently. It was very well received, with attendance much in excess of what was expected. As part of this programme, many of the attendees opted for a one-on-one consult on their personal finances. This exercise made us sit up and take a closer look at something we’ve been seeing on and off over the years — the fact that many people make simple yet fundamental mistakes that can seriously hamper their wealth creation journey. We list out five of those mistakes below.1 Underestimating inflationStory continues below AdvertisementRemove AdAlmost everyone we interact with is keen on being financially free in 10 years or less but they are unable to estimate the effect of inflation on their expenses. A good rule of thumb to remember would be that at 7 percent inflation, your expenses will nearly double every 10 years, even when you are conscious of not unnecessarily upgrading your lifestyle.So, if you’re spending X amount today, you will be spending 2X in 10 years, 4X in 20 years, 8X in 30 years and so on. Simply put, because people underestimate the effect of inflation, the actual corpus required for financial freedom is often much in excess of what people estimate it to be.Another fallout of the effects of inflation is buying products such as money-back and endowment insurance, which pay back a fixed amount at the end of 10 or 15 or 20 years. What needs to be kept in mind is that the actual value of the money you receive will be half in 10 years and one-fourth in 20 years. Hence, while the payout seems substantial today and the purchase seems to make sense, when you add the inflation angle, the security and peace of mind you get on buying these products is short-lived.

The news published on the date May 12, 2022 10:30 AM IST with headline  Active mutual funds have an edge over passive funds in the long run is: 
 An active fund manager is often judged on the alpha or performance of the fund he manages compared to a suitable benchmark, such as the BSE 500 (if it is a flexicap fund) or BSE 100 or an equivalent index (if it is a large-cap fund).The goal of an active fund manager is to beat the market—to get better returns by choosing investments he or she believes to be top-performing selections. On the other hand, passive funds seek to replicate the performance of their benchmarks instead of outperforming them. For instance, the manager of an index fund that tracks the performance of the BSE 500 typically buys a portfolio that includes all of the stocks in that index in the same proportions as they are represented in the index.While the goal of active management is to generate alpha, it is important to know how many fund managers have actually managed to beat the benchmark. In developed markets like the US, 85 percent of the active managers underperformed the market in 2021. In fact, not only in 2021, but a Morningstar report suggests that over a 10-year period, only 25 percent of all active funds beat their passive counterparts in the US.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdIn contrast, in India, on average the active manager has outperformed the benchmark. In this article we will explore this divergence so as to answer what makes Indian markets so different as far as alpha generation is concerned and the key lessons we can draw as investors. In 2021, more than 60 percent of the active equity schemes in India’s mutual fund space beat their respective benchmarks.In fact studies over the last decade suggest that the alpha generation potential of a market like India is higher than that of any other emerging and developed market. A Wall Street Journal study found that during the 10-year period from 2009 to 2018, an average active manager in India generated annualised excess return of 3 percent, the highest globally. In comparison, the average active fund manager in the US underperformed by 2 percent annually while an average European large-cap manager would have performed in line with the market.One of the key reasons for the alpha generation potential in a market like India is the presence of a well-diversified small- and midcap segment. There is a distinct mid- and small-cap segment within every sector, which makes India different from other emerging and even a few developed markets which are more homogeneous in nature.

 Sanjay Sapre is the current President of Franklin Templeton India. His term ends in July 2022. Late evening on April 23, 2020, Sanjay Sapre, president of Franklin Templeton Asset Management (India) Ltd, made probably, one of the most awkward public announcements in his life—that of winding up six of the fund house’s marquee debt funds. These were all open-ended debt funds and weren’t meant to be shut down. Franklin Templeton believed that by winding up the schemes, it would buy the fund house time to sell its illiquid securities once market conditions improved. At the time, the COVID-19 global pandemic was declared, equity markets had fallen sharply and the debt market had frozen.Debt fund investors rushed to take their money out and fund houses everywhere saw redemptions. Franklin Templeton India was the worst affected because it had been running a high-yield strategy across six of its debt schemes, totaling assets worth Rs 25,215 crore as of April 23, 2020.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdIts strategy involved investing in securities that came with low credit ratings but companies where the fund management saw potential of paying its interests, albeit higher than others, on time and timely principal repayment. But when the debt market froze due to COVID-19, buyers shunned bad quality securities of the sort Franklin Templeton held. And so, Sapre and his team started their defence that the funds had to be wound up due to COVID-19-led illiquidity, and not due to the fund house’s own strategy. The verdict is still out.But there has been some light at the end of the tunnel. Over the past two years, Franklin Templeton has sold most of its illiquid securities as markets and the Indian economy opened up. It has paid most of the investors’ money. SBI Funds Management Ltd, India’s largest mutual fund house and the Supreme Court-appointed liquidator, managed to sell off most of six schemes’ illiquid securities in the last nine-odd months. Franklin Templeton is now getting ready to move on. It wants to go back to distributors and investors and wants to start accepting money again. Moneycontrol’s Jash Kriplani and Kayezad E. Adajania caught up with Sapre at his office for a chat on how Franklin Templeton aims to win back investors’ confidence, whether Franklin Templeton looking to sell out and leave India or if it want to stay on and get back on track.A side note: Some of the questions we asked Sapre are sub judice as the matter is still being heard in court (the Securities Appellate Tribunal) and quite likely the Supreme Court, thereafter.

 Representative image. In April 2020, Franklin Templeton India Mutual Fund shocked investors when it abruptly wound up six debt funds. COVID-19 had been declared a pandemic in March. As the viral disease spread across the world, equity markets had fallen by 37 percent in 40 days and debt markets froze. Faced with massive redemptions and illiquid portfolios, Templeton decided it could not encash most securities in its debt portfolio. Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdAt about 9 pm on April 23, 2020, the fund house announced that it was winding up the six debt schemes – Franklin India Ultra Short Bond Fund (FIUBF), Franklin India Low Duration Fund (FILDF), Franklin India Short Term Income Plan (FISTIP), Franklin India Income Opportunities Fund (FIIOF), Franklin India Credit Risk Fund (FICRF) and Franklin India Dynamic Accrual Fund (FIDAF).At the time, Franklin Templeton was India’s ninth largest fund house, with average assets under management (January-March 2020) of Rs 1.16 lakh crore. The combined assets under management of the six debt schemes was Rs 25,215 crore as of April 23, 2020. Two years on, investors in the schemes have been returned most of their money. As of April 23, 2022, Franklin Templeton returned Rs 26,098 crore back to investors. The reason why investors got a bit more than the April 2020-end corpus was because the securities earned interest during the intervening period. And some securities were also sold at a gain, which provided capital gains to the portfolio.
 
The news published on the date April 16, 2022 01:08 PM IST with headline  82% of large-cap schemes underperform benchmarks over the last 5 years: SPIVA report is: 
 It’s getting tougher for actively managed equity funds to outperform their benchmark indices. Many actively managed equity mutual fund schemes have underperformed the indices, according to the S&P Indices Versus Active Funds (SPIVA) India Scorecard for 2021.Half of the Indian large-cap equity schemes underperformed the S&P BSE 100 index in the year ended December 31, 2021. Over five years, 82 percent of the large-cap schemes underperformed the S&P BSE 100 index.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdSPIVA also compares the performance of equity linked savings schemes with the S&P BSE 200 index. Over one year, 26.8 percent of actively managed ELSS schemes underperformed the index, while over the past five years, 79 percent of them underperformed.Among mid- and small-sized schemes, the underperformance was 50 percent over one year and 58 percent over five years when compared to the S&P BSE 400 MidSmallCap Index.The SPIVA scorecard considers plans with the highest assets while computing their performance. If a regular plan has greater assets under management than a direct plan, then the performance of the regular plan is considered. The performance of direct plans is considered if it has higher assets under management than that of a regular plan. This means that the SPIVA report largely accounts for the performance of regular plans, which are compared with the total returns index in India.

The news published on the date April 12, 2022 10:38 AM IST with headline  Prashant Jain of HDFC MF is prepared for volatility and is betting on sectors like capital goods and energy is: 
 Image credit: Suneesh K The collective size of just the three equity schemes that Prashant Jain, executive director and chief investment officer at HDFC Asset Management Co Ltd, manages is over Rs 88,400 crore. Among his three marquee schemes, Jain has managed HDFC Balanced Advantage Fund since its inception, i.e., over 28 years. In the Rs 37 trillion mutual fund industry, no other fund manager has managed a single mutual fund scheme for as long. After a weak performance phase due to a narrow run on equity markets that punished the value style of investing, Jain’s schemes have made a comeback.Recently, Jain was a guest on Moneycontrol Pro Masters Virtual, where he spoke on the Russia-Ukraine crisis, the impact of inflation and rising oil prices on the Indian economy and markets, and what investors should do.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdThe Russia-Ukraine war may have started in February, but equity markets have been volatile since October 2021, presumably on the expectation of the US Fed raising interest rates from early 2022. Then, of course, the Russia-Ukraine war worsened it. The S&P BSE Sensex had touched 61,000 in October 2021, fell to 56,000 in December, rallied above 60,000 in January, fell to 52,000 in March and is back again at 60,000. Your comments on this volatility.Equity markets staged a smart recovery from Covid lows when they traded below 50 percent market cap to GDP to around 110 percent during the last quarter of 2021. These levels are above long-term averages. Also, the crisis-induced loose fiscal and monetary conditions are expected to normalise. Therefore, some heightened volatility around these levels is reasonable to expect. The recovery in recent weeks is, among other things, a result of the view that the ongoing war will have a limited impact on the Indian economy and (that there will be) a tapering in FPI outflows.Given the time correction over the last few quarters, currently, the market cap-to-GDP ratio of Indian markets is approximately 95 percent, which is reasonable. Markets have held up well despite significant FPI selling due to healthy domestic flows — direct and through mutual funds. This is an encouraging development and it reflects how equities have gained wider acceptance.

It was alleged that Invesco India’s fixed income team executed trades on behalf of their offshore funds, in violation of regulations requiring the execution to be done by the offshore counterparts because their relationship was advisory in nature.The third allegation is that after the default by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services in 2018, the fixed income team of Invesco MF identified securities of other companies including Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd. that were likely to come under stress and transferred them to the offshore funds. While the transfer itself was not illegal at the time, the matter of concern was that the clean-up was done at the cost of offshore clients.

The way we live, work and think has all changed. The time at home was also spent in reading, educating ourselves and contemplating. It is perhaps this awareness that is also reflected in the way we invest.Over the last year, mutual fund investing has seen a visible change. Investors have moved from active investing to passive investing.In an actively managed fund, an experienced fund manager takes all buying and selling decisions based on his outlook of the market. Whereas in a passive fund, also known as index funds, stocks are bought and sold based on their weightage in the index. Passive investing is done through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest in the index and do not require close monitoring. These funds mimic the performance of the indices.
 
The news published on the date March 07, 2022 06:28 AM IST with headline  Index funds: Check their tracking errors instead of returns is: 
 The appeal of passive investments—putting money in funds where the manager does not make any active calls—is that they will deliver market-related returns (won’t underperform the benchmark index) and their expense ratio is lower than actively managed funds.The differential between the market index and such a fund is the extent of their expense ratios and possibly a little more due to a small cash component to manage redemptions. To this end, the performance of index funds has been improving.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdTo be sure, the performance of passive funds is not measured conventionally—we do not look at the returns delivered. We look at a metric called the tracking error, which gauges how much the returns have deviated from those of the benchmark index.Ideally, the returns of such funds should match those of the underlying index but due to expenses and cash equivalent component, it may be a little lower, say 99.9 percent. Obviously, the lower the tracking error, the better.Statistically, the tracking error is defined as the annualised standard deviation of the difference in returns between the index fund and its corresponding index.

 Christopher Wood, global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, pointed out an ongoing shift in investor preference from growth to value stocks as rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve loom in the wake of rising inflation."The change in equity market leadership looks ever more pronounced in terms of the shift from growth to value stocks as investors have discounted ever more rate hikes following last week's higher US inflation," Wood said in the Jefferies Greed & Fear report.The report says since mid-November, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks by 16.1%.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdMoney markets are discounting 150 basis points of Fed tightening in 2022 while credit spreads have continued to widen, a process that surely can continue only so long as the Fed is perceived to be behind the curve, the report said.The US high yield corporate bond yield spread rose to 3.67% last Friday -- highest level since December 2020 -- and is now 3.54% from 2.7% last December."Overall the current situation can best be summarised as the inverse of Goldilocks.

The news published on the date January 27, 2024 10:20 AM IST with headline  Moneycontrol Pro Weekender | The Budget must set the stage for strong long-term growth  is: 
 - Dear Reader,The big question in the forthcoming interim Budget is: Will it be a pre-election one, replete with sops? At first glance, there appears to be little need for handouts, what with real GDP growth widely expected to be around 7 percent for the next few years. Corporate and bank balance sheets are in fine shape and investment demand is powering the economy. Bank credit is growing robustly. The stock markets are scaling new highs. Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdIt’s true that the pre-election interim Budget of 2019 was a populist one, as we pointed out here. But then, real GDP growth in 2023-24 is estimated at 7.3 percent while it was 6.5 percent in 2018-19. Surely, the economy can now do without new sops?But look under the hood and a rather different picture emerges. First and foremost, as the IMF’s Fiscal Monitor points out, the overall deficit of the Centre and the states is estimated to be 8.8 percent of GDP in 2023-24, compared to 6.4 percent in 2018-19. And the gross debt of the Centre and the states is estimated at 81.9 percent of GDP in 2023-24, against 70.4 percent of GDP in 2018-19. What’s more, the central government has promised to prune its fiscal deficit down to 4.5 percent of GDP by 2025-26, from the current fiscal year’s estimate of 5.9 percent. Hence, the need for substantial fiscal consolidation. That’s why IndusInd Bank chief economist Gaurav Kapur wrote here: “The Budget should thus focus on strengthening the long-term growth impulses provided by public investments, building fiscal buffers to counter future shocks, and putting public debt on a downward path to free up space for productive spending.”But there’s a catch. Consumption growth, the GDP estimates show, will be the lowest in many years in the current fiscal year. Growth in the farm sector is estimated to be a mere 1.8 percent year-on-year. Average real rural wages for men in November, the latest month for which data are available from the Labour Bureau, show y-o-y growth of a piffling 0.2 percent. Rural food inflation, which was 0.2 percent in 2018-19, was at 8.97 percent in December 2023.

 Indonesia's citizens get ready to elect their next president on February 14, and the video in question is intended to "remind people of their responsibility to make the right decisions" (Bloomberg Opinion) -- As deepfakes go, it’s not a great one. Even so, the viral video of Indonesia’s former president and dictator Suharto that was created using artificial intelligence took the world’s most populous Muslim nation by storm. It racked up millions of views on social media, and prompted hand-wringing about the dangers of using this kind of technology.“I am President Suharto, the second president of Indonesia, inviting you to elect representatives of the people from Golkar,” the figure in the video says. The man behind it, Erwin Aksa, is a member of Golkar, the political party the former leader presided over for the 32 years he was in power. It is the nation’s oldest operating party, stemming from the New Order era, one of the most corrupt dictatorships in Southeast Asia’s history. The party was hugely powerful and influential, and all government employees were expected to vote for it.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdTurns out running a country is pretty easy, when you control everything. Golkar hasn’t had that kind of power since Suharto fell amid the unrest that engulfed the archipelago in 1998. But as citizens get ready to elect their next president on Feb. 14, Aksa said on Instagram that the video was intended to remind people of their responsibility to make the right decisions.Suharto’s appeal, despite his authoritarianism, is not new. During the 2014 elections, I travelled to his hometown in Kemusuk in Central Java, as millions prepared to directly elect only their third president since the transition from dictatorship to democracy began. It was hard to miss the love that many still have for the man they affectionately call “the father of the nation.” At the time, T-shirts featuring his face were being sold, with slogans in Javanese saying: “It was better in my time, wasn’t it?”This desire for a return to perceived stability is not unusual, but it is worrying given Indonesia’s importance in regional power dynamics.

 Although Vietnam's current output is a tiny percentage of global supply, the nation is sitting on around 17% of known reserves, second only to China (Bloomberg Opinion) -- Vietnam’s hopes of becoming a production hub to rival China are showing momentum. A big boost will come as the nation leans into its untapped reserves of rare earths, even as it struggles to find traction in new sectors such as electric vehicles.Over the past decade, the country has built a beachhead in manufacturing, ranging from cars to electronics. Computers and accessories are now the largest export, surpassing textiles and footwear. The expansion of foreign assemblers like Foxconn Technology Group, GoerTek Inc. and Luxshare Precision Industry Co. mean that Apple Inc. products like Macs and AirPods are made locally. While that energy has spurred the birth of other businesses, some have stumbled. Electric-vehicle maker VinFast Auto Ltd., for example, last week posted full-year shipments that missed its own forecast by more than 20%.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdAlthough Apple now has 25 supplier sites in Vietnam, that still pales in comparison to 151 for China and 41 in Taiwan. A key reason is the high concentration of component manufacturers in China. The transfer out of China into India, Vietnam, and Mexico has largely revolved around the final stage of the process when devices are put together like Lego. There’s been very little movement at the other end of the supply chain, where parts like chips, magnets, and diodes are produced.Rare earth minerals are uncommon — though the moniker “rare” is debated — yet crucial to modern industry. Many have unique electrical and magnetic properties that make them useful in electronics, EVs, medical equipment and lasers.Vietnam’s abundance of these ores is catching the attention of its government as well as foreign leaders. Its own hopes for the sector are bold. From just 400 tons of rare-earth-oxides produced in 2021, output shot up to 4,300 tons in 2022. That’s just 1.4% of global supply, and far behind the 210,000 tons from China, according to estimate by the US Geological Survey. In July, Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha approved plans to supercharge expansion, aiming to process as much as 62,500 tons of rare-earth minerals by 2030.

 Unified Payments Interface is used by 300 million Indians to instantly settle bills. Even the smallest of shopkeepers accept UPI payments (Bloomberg Opinion) -- Depending on whom you ask, consumer credit in India is either growing too rapidly or not trickling down fast enough. Bankers speak with awe of the industry’s phenomenal expansion, which is so fast-paced that the regulator is starting to get concerned. Fintech players like to draw attention to its lopsided distribution. The industry keeps chasing a fraction of affluent urban professionals to the exclusion of everyone else. Broaden access, they say, and the scorching growth may become more sustainable.For lenders, however, the problem with adding new borrowers is the incremental cost. The economics of even modest democratization — to a wider section of regular wage earners, for instance in factory townships — makes the concept a nonstarter.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdTake credit cards, of which there are nearly 100 million in circulation. It’s a small number for a country of 1.4 billion people, but double from five years ago, underscoring significant expansion. And yet, it’s the same group of 40 million well-heeled Indians who keep getting more cards. Fewer than 13% of Indians over 15 years of age borrow from formal sources, including credit cards. In China, the number is nearly 40%, thanks to a multiyear boom in digital lending before a regulatory crackdown on Ant Group Co. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., the two major players.During the pandemic, India saw an invasion of sorts by predatory Chinese lending apps, but the regulators have chased them away. Out of more than 60 banks in India, about 75% of the entire credit-card franchise by value is with just four — HDFC Bank Ltd., State Bank of India, ICICI Bank Ltd., and Axis Bank Ltd. The reason more lenders aren’t interested in getting into the business or expanding it is that the cost of acquiring and servicing customers works out to about 6,000 rupees ($70) per client, including specialized software for collection and risk management. It isn’t possible to recoup this expense from the spending of someone earning, say, 40,000 rupees a month, middle of the range for what an outsourcing company typically pays fresh coding talent.But what if there was a way? Not with expensive credit-card architecture, but by employing India’s ubiquitous smartphone-based payment protocol that logged more than 100 billion transactions last year.

The news published on the date January 25, 2024 04:07 PM IST with headline  Marco Polo and the saga of Venice is: 
 Playing and sabotaging markets? Venice has been there and done that. The Travels of Marco Polo was a bestseller a century-and-a-half before printing presses changed Western civilisation forever.The book comes down to us through seven centuries, several titles, a number of languages, innumerable textual variations, and perhaps 150 manuscripts from the 14th century alone. But when it first began circulating, the volume had one biting Italian nickname: Il Milione — the million, as in the number of lies to be found within. That was also the word some readers hurled at its Venetian originator, who was certainly aware of the incredulity triggered by his description of the riches and wonders of the empire of Kublai Khan and the Mongols. As he lay dying in January 1324 in Venice, Polo declared to people at his bedside, “I have not told you half of what I saw because I knew I wouldn’t be believed.”Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdOn Saturday, Venice combines the septicentennial anniversary of his death with the annual two-week carnivale, the street fair/costume ball that lasts till the eve of Ash Wednesday. According to an Italian tourist website, the theme of this year’s carnival — Ad Oriente, “to the East” — is “travel, discovery and encounters with previously only imagined worlds.” As if tourists need any more encouragement.The truth, of course, is that Marco Polo’s description of points east of Venice ceased being imaginary centuries ago — most famously, or infamously, inspiring Christopher Columbus to undertake treasure-hunting journeys across the Atlantic, landing in the Americas, which just happened to be on the way to China.Philologists have also teased out real-life cities and sites from Polo’s sometimes mysterious place names: Chandu (the Xanadu of Coleridge and Olivia Newton-John) is Shangtu, Chinese for “upper capital,” where the Mongols summered. They wintered in Cambaluc, derived from khanbaliq(Mongol or Uighur for the Khan’s city), which is now Beijing. The word for Polo’s favorite metropolis, Quinsai, comes from the Chinese xingzai(“temporary stay”), a designation that the Southern Song emperors gave Hangzhou, their interim capital, as they dreamed of reconquering lost territory, that is until Kublai’s army put a full stop to those aspirations.

The news published on the date January 24, 2024 02:27 PM IST with headline  Euro’s status languishes as dollar still king after 25 years is: 
 While the fall in euro usage and corresponding jump in dollar dominance may have been overdone last year. The euro celebrates 25 years of virtual existence this month, with its digital creation in 1999 followed by the introduction of physical notes and coins in 2002. It's embedded successfully as the domestic means of exchange within the 20-nation euro zone. While its survival is no longer threatened, the common currency has made little progress in its broader aim of challenging the dollar's role as the world’s reserve currency — and has instead gone backward.De-dollarisation is a perennial theme, but the greenback remains king. The use of the euro in SWIFT transactions — the main global system for cross-border payments — fell to 22 percent by the end of last year from 38 percent in January. The dollar took a corresponding leap, with usage climbing to 48 percent from 40 percent. Most of this was due to a change in market practice when SWIFT changed its calculation method to more accurately measure commercial bank data sent to the European Central Bank; but the common currency has failed to fulfill the aspirations of its founders.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdIt's worth noting that usage of "other" currencies also rose, to 15 percent from 10 percent during 2023. The Chinese yuan edged up to a 4 percent share, just pushing into the fourth spot ahead of the Japanese yen, with sterling staying in third place. Change is afoot, though — global payment flows may no longer be comprehensively captured in SWIFT data.Bilateral trade between China and Russia and the rest of the BRICS+ confederation is hard to assess, but the potential for an increase is clearly there. Kit Juckes, chief currency strategist at Societe Generale SA, told me the real story is about fragmentation. He reckons it's becoming much harder to get an accurate reading of the data, but expects over time the disruption from the pandemic and heightened geopolitical woes will lead to less trade occurring in both dollars and euros.The fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine is also diminishing the euro’s market share, according to Mark Tinker, chief executive officer of ToscaFund Hong Kong Ltd. In his Market Thinking substack blog, Tinker argues that the March 2022 ban on Russia using SWIFT combined with other sanctions prompted Europe to buy liquid natural gas from the US and Qatar in dollars. As the BRICS+ start to use fewer dollars, Europe in turn is being forced to use the US currency more frequently.

The news published on the date January 24, 2024 10:16 AM IST with headline  Rate Cuts: The last mile of inflation has a bad reputation is: 
 rate cuts In the rapidly evolving outlook for interest rates, some things are still sacrosanct. The pace of price increases has slowed significantly, and the argument is now how much — rather than when — borrowing costs will be lowered this year. Traders have latched on to the idea that relief will come by March, and some economists even flag a period of below-target inflation. The folks actually making the decisions sound unconvinced, and have fallen back on two lines of defense that can use a rigorous stress test.Despite bets they will capitulate within months, officials cling to a couple of well-worn phrases: the last mile of the inflation fight is the hardest, and the very worst thing would be to declare victory. The assertions are related. They translate to “Don't push us, the spike of 2021 and 2022 remains too raw.” Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, chided traders last week and warned that speculation about cuts is unhelpful to policy deliberations. It's almost as if raising the issue is a punishable offense.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdSalons in Davos last week were replete with denials that a win is at hand. Nor has the refutation been limited to chattering on the slopes. “Mission is not accomplished yet, but it's on track,” Ravi Menon, who led the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said in one of his last interviews before retiring from the civil service in December. The International Monetary Fundrecently urged officials to stand firm in “the very last mile” of the inflation fight. What did this last mile do to have warranted, in equal measure, such vilification and reverence?A new paper from the Federal Reserve investigated the last-mile theory and found it wanting. David Rapach, an economist at the Atlanta Fed, wrote that the analogy is grounded in a long race where an athlete tires as the end is in sight and needs extra exertions to get there. The finish line is the 2 percent inflation target. The Fed's preferred measure rose 2.6 percent in November from a year earlier, within striking distance.The concern is that the last stretch will require something more. Officials will need to extract an additional cost from the economy in terms of jobs and growth. However, it's not obvious to Rapach that the sporting analogy works. “For the last 1 to 2 percentage points of disinflation to be fundamentally more difficult than the preceding decline in inflation, there must be some sort of structural mechanism that makes the last mile different from the rest,” he argued. “Such mechanisms are not readily apparent in conventional macroeconomic models. Thus, the contention that the last mile of disinflation is more arduous deserves serious scrutiny.”

The news published on the date January 23, 2024 04:46 PM IST with headline  The number that hijacked the UK housing crisis is: 
 Does average household size determine the number of homes needed, or does the availability of supply determine household size? (Source: Bloomberg) Britain’s two main political parties don’t agree on much, but they agree on how to tackle the country’s housing crisis: Build 300,000 homes a year. The ruling Conservative Party adopted this target in 2017, downgrading it to an advisory goal in late 2022 after construction repeatedly fell short. The opposition Labour Party, which is favoured to win a general election likely to be held this year, says it too will aim for the same objective. For a number that has inspired such widespread acceptance, it has a curiously murky provenance.Where does it come from? No one seems entirely sure, including Parliament itself. “The 300,000 figure is not universally accepted as the ‘right’ number of homes to aim for,” a House of Commons research briefing said in May, noting that both the public accounts committee and the housing, communities and local government committee had highlighted “the lack of information on the government’s basis for settling on this figure.”Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdThe origin of the number isn’t an idle query. Some analysts question whether the UK has a shortage at all, arguing this is an affordability crisis that can be only marginally affected by increasing supply. So knowing the rationale behind such estimates is useful to understanding how policymakers should approach one of the country’s biggest economic challenges.The genesis of the target can be traced to a 2013 report by economist Alan Holmans, who estimated a need for 240,000 to 245,000 homes a year in England through 2031. That number then appears to have been rounded up by government ministers, according to Ian Mulheirn, former chief economist at the London-based Tony Blair Institute and a housing-shortage sceptic. Whether the upward revision was an attempt to compensate for exceptionally low levels of construction in the mid-2010s or simply because politicians (like journalists) are drawn to big round numbers isn’t clear. Either way, 300,000 entered the parliamentary echo chamber and became part of the received wisdom.Mulheirn calls the 300,000 figure “entirely arbitrary” and says it is about twice what’s indicated by the growth in households. While the Holmans study was authoritative, the demographic projections underpinning his estimate turned out to be more benign in practice. For example, the government repeatedly predicted average household size would keep falling, as it had in the 1980s and 1990s. Smaller households imply a need for more homes. In the event, the trend flattened.

The news published on the date January 23, 2024 04:29 PM IST with headline  Chevron would fit better in Texas than California is: 
 Maybe Chevron has outstayed its welcome in California. (Source: Bloomberg/Getty Images North America) Chevron Corp has a strong a sense of nostalgia about its home base of California. In an interview with Bloomberg Television last week, Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth lauded the company’s nearly 150-year long history in the Golden State, adding: “We are the only large oil company left in California.” Which begs the question: why stay?The paths of Chevron and California are diverging inexorably. The state, led by Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, is hostile to the fossil-fuel industry, despite voracious consumption of petroleum products there. Worse, the oil company’s bosses have become a convenient scapegoat for local politicians seeking to burnish their credentials with voters. It’s not just a political distraction; it’s also hurting the bottom line.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdEarlier this month, Chevron announced it would write down the value of its oil production assets in California by several billion dollars “due to continuing regulatory challenges.” At the same time, the firm is fighting California regulators over the so-called margin penalty law. Those rules allow the state to set the maximum profit refiners can make processing crude oil into gasoline because... well, it seems the laws of supply, demand and prices don’t apply to the oil industry; capitalism is for everyone, bar fossil-fuel firms.Chevron is transfixed by a sentimental yearning for the happiness of a former era. The petroleum giant has been in California since 1876, when its earliest processor, the California Star Oil Works, struck oil in the Santa Susana mountains north of Los Angeles. Soon after, it built an oil refinery in the San Francisco Bay Area, which it still operates, and turned the city into its corporate base. But times have changed.Unsurprisingly, Chevron plans to spend far less money in California than it did in the past because, Wirth explained, those “investments are less and less attractive.” Still, the company remains loyal to its California roots as the location of its headquarters. But Chevron and its executives need to put sentimentality aside. It’s time to pack up and relocate. The move would deliver two benefits: It makes business sense, and it would send a strong message.

 All about the packaging. (Source: Bloomberg) Can we buy an American company before an American company buys us?It’s a question facing the chief executive officers of many European businesses. And it lurks in the background of Smurfit Kappa Group Plc’s planned takeover of US packaging peer WestRock Co. The Dublin-based firm has hatched a deal that drives US expansion and makes it invulnerable to being taken over itself. The snag? The plan irks a shareholder activist.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdBuying a US counterpart using shares is a daring but tempting course for many non-US companies. Global clout depends on having a strong US presence. In many industries, the publicly traded US players command higher valuations. Smurfit’s deal aims to combine businesses with a total market value of $19 billion before talks became public in September, reap synergies and capture the benefits of a New York listing and likely S&P 500 inclusion. Yet Smurfit would retain its Irish domicile and its chair, CEO and chief financial officer.The alternative US tie-ups don’t look so appealing. International Paper Co is too big for Smurfit to buy; Packaging Corp of America too richly valued. WestRock has had a difficult few years and its share rating has suffered. So Smurfit’s offer for the company is priced at a roughly comparable valuation to its own despite including a premium. Each side’s shareholders would own about half the enlarged business, sharing equally in merger-related savings. The hope would be that new leadership can drive WestRock’s humdrum margins higher and the combined company’s shares will achieve a higher earnings multiple closer to better-rated US rivals.Investors aren’t so sure. Smurfit stock crumpled on the deal announcement. Primestone Capital LLP, a London-based activist fund, has articulated the key concern: WestRock is cheap for a reason. It thinks even Smurfit’s high-caliber management team could struggle to improve the performance of what it’s buying. Smurfit lacks the required breadth of US expertise and WestRock needs “catch-up” investment to modernise its plants, Primestone reckons.

 Davos shows an India that is affluent, that consumes luxury goods, and goes after wealth creation. Dear Reader, The annual 5-day jamboree of the world’s moneymakers and policymakers at Davos is winding up as we write this newsletter. The gathering, hosted by the World Economic Forum, has little to show for real progress beyond endless discussions if past shindigs are observed. Indeed, at best Davos is an offsite for government officials and businessmen and at worst, it resembles the physical form of social media platform X (twitter) if Hallmark had taken it over instead of Elon Musk.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdThis Financial Times article titled 'In remembrance of Davos times past' presents the growing irrelevance of the platform. But for now, the Swiss Alpine town presents a place for India and developing nations to hard sell themselves.India is going all guns blazing to position itself as the destination for business, investment, and the next big thing: Artificial intelligence. Minister for Electronics and Information Technology Ashwini Vaishnaw is convinced India will be a major semiconductor chip manufacturer in five years. Heads of business conglomerates have done their bit in drumming up their support for the economy and, also getting a large platform to network for their businesses. You can catch all that happened and was said through our extensive coverage of Davos here.India’s central bank Governor Shaktikanta Das is also presenting the economy’s prospects in his own genial way. Das said India’s growth momentum will sustain, and real GDP growth could surprise around 7 percent. Unlike the jawboning of government officials, Das’s statements do not come out as an attempt at self-praise but rather are rooted in data. Macroeconomic data has been robust for the Indian economy in recent times and the proof of the pudding is the rise and rise of the Indian stock market.

Its impact will be felt everywhere from London hospital wards and Los Angeles wharves to dinner tables across the Middle East.While still a relatively young nation, the Philippines is determined to reduce its birthrate, and sees much smaller families as a route to the prosperity enjoyed elsewhere. It wants a place in the pantheon of Asian success stories alongside nations like Singapore and Malaysia. The archipelago of 115 million people has already made meaningful progress, thanks in part to the reduced sway of the Roman Catholic Church and the ensuing easing of restrictions on contraception.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdWorries about a baby drought and decades-later silver tsunami of too many old people are for societies that have already grown rich. They are tomorrow’s problems. Family planning volunteer Remy Cabello embodies the changes underway — she raised two children, but has a dozen siblings. “People are becoming more knowledgeable,” Cabello told me during her rounds in one of Manila’s poorest neighbourhoods. With smaller families,“they can budget their money, they can give a better education to their kids, give sufficient financial support and nutrition. They are taking care not just of their kids, but of their lives.”What matters for Manila is capitalizing on the momentum generated by sharp declines in fertility and using the coming decade or two to invest in education, technology and infrastructure. Consistent and pronounced reductions in the size of families were key characteristics of the rapid economic takeoff enjoyed by South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China. That enabled huge inroads in curbing poverty and left the rising, increasingly urbanized middle class with more cash and an expanding array of consumer goods. For governments, the idea is to use the window to make the leap to industrialization and a workforce equipped for a modern economy. It’s a concept replete with opportunity, and huge hurdles, for the Philippines.For the world labor market, though, this is a slow-burning challenge. Filipinos perform critical, though often under-appreciated, roles in social and economic systems far from home. This isn't simply about agencies in Hong Kong and Singapore having enough domestic helpers to supply middle-class households. Nor is it just guys working construction in the Middle East. Healthcare systems in the US and Europe have come to rely on nurses from the Philippines; recruiters fan out to colleges and clinics, offering spotting fees into the thousands of dollars for referrals of friends and colleagues.

 How to invest when the objective is to ensure that the family retains buying power at the same level in the next generation? Most of us, when we start investing, it is with a very small corpus, unless we are lucky to have an inherited portfolio. The lure of making a lot of money in the stock market beckons. Reading the exploits of the legends like Warren Buffett or Jim Simons or our very own Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, we dream big. The problem we try to solve for is wealth creation.On the other hand, there is another class of investor, who has a completely different challenge. They have made their money, mostly from their businesses, and have either sold out or taken out a substantial portion to create a sizeable portfolio. And now they wish to invest it. This takes many forms – family offices, family trusts, family portfolios etc.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdIn the last few years, I have been associated with a few large family offices and have gathered a fair understanding of the psychology of this type of investment. The most important aspect in this form of investing is not wealth creation but wealth preservation. Here, the objective is not to look for the next multibagger but to ensure that the family retains buying power at the same level in the next generation.Capital Preservation: Play Defence Before OffenceWhen I was first asked to help guide the investment of one such family a few years back, in the midst of Covid, it gave me a great sense of responsibility. Here the capital is all that the family had. It was irreplaceable. If it was lost, it can never be replaced. It represented a lifetime of effort, earnings and savings of the family. Now that the business was sold, there was going to be no more capital coming in. So, capital preservation had to be the most important factor.

 Green hydrogen key to India's net zero journey: Adani Billionaire Gautam Adani on Tuesday said green hydrogen holds the key to India's journey to net-zero carbon emissions, and its current high cost can be reduced by replicating the solar power model. In a blog post for the World Economic Forum (WEF), the head of apples-to-airport Adani Group said leapfrogging to renewables and green hydrogen will help India achieve energy security and improve air quality in cities.Green hydrogen produced by splitting water using renewable electricity is a clean fuel with no carbon emissions. It can be used as a feedstock in industries like steel and oil refineries and as fuel in automobiles and produces water on being burnt. "Renewable energy has come a long way but relies on the right weather conditions; green hydrogen could be a viable alternative to fossil fuels," Adani said.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdGreen hydrogen relies on renewable energy. And so the production cost of renewable energy must fall faster than green hydrogen's to be viable. Vertical integration, where a company takes on all upstream and downstream activities associated with its main offering, could significantly reduce green hydrogen production costs, he said."Green hydrogen may be the last mile in the net-zero journey for many sectors, especially in India," he said. However, its current cost is high and needs to be brought down."For India, the equitable solution is not to replace one fossil fuel with another but to leapfrog to renewables and green hydrogen," he said. "The decrease in solar costs can be replicated in green hydrogen." The cost of electricity generated from solar panels in 2011 was Rs 15 per kilowatt-hour (or per unit), which has now fallen to Rs 1.99 per unit – the lowest in the world.

It's not that China's economy requires merely some fine-tuning. When the consumer price index began declining in July, the slide was characterised as a blip and not a feature of the disappointing overall recovery. The fall in December was the third in a row and marks the longest deflationary streak since 2009.PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng may not have wanted to rain on the big event this week, the release of fourth-quarter gross domestic product numbers.

 consumption IIP Dear Reader, Last week ended with news that Tata Consumer Products, which has been on the prowl for big acquisitions for some time, bagged two companies. One was Capital Foods that has carved out a niche with its range of Chinese noodles, sauces and condiments and another was Organic India, which sells premium products in categories such as teas and infusions and packaged foods.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdThe amount in question is significant at Rs 7,000 crore and may have been even higher but for the structure. The Organic India purchase is for a 100 percent stake, but involves an additional payout if the business hits certain targets in FY26. The Capital Foods acquisition involves Tata Consumer buying a 75 percent stake, with the founder staying on as a consultant. Tata Consumer retains a right to purchase the balance 25 percent stake belonging to the founder over three years. This implies that the founder helps run the business, helping Tata Consumer meet its integration and business targets, and potentially may earn a higher payout for the stake. Do read our two takes on the acquisition, here and here.Making acquisitions work, it is said, depends a lot on culture and strategy, some say. But success of these two acquisitions also depends on how well India’s consumer market grows in the coming years. One of the worries facing FMCG companies at present is that the market is not seeing uniform growth across consuming classes. Companies are reporting good growth in the premium segments despite headwinds such as stiff inflation. But the mass segments are seeing cracks, as reported by companies.One question that remains to be answered is whether it is solely income stress that is reflecting in performance or whether the organised players have raised prices so much, that consumers are shifting to lower-priced brands sold by smaller, regional players or even unbranded products.

(Source: Bloomberg) When traffic through the Suez Canal ground to a halt in 2021, the extraordinary cost and disruptions to global commerce seemed overwhelming. But 5,000 miles from the canals of Suez and Panama lie even more important shipping lanes, chokepoints that could cripple global trade should any disaster befall them.More than a quarter of goods transport passes through a 25-mile wide stretch of water that separates Indonesia to the southwest from Singapore and Malaysia to the northeast, known as the Malacca Strait. By value, the 27.9 percent of merchandise sent around the world that traverses this body of water far exceeds the 16.6 percent that move along the Suez Canal in Egypt, according to research by Professor Lincoln Pratson at Duke University’s Nicholas School of the Environment.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdIn a paper published last month in the journal Communications in Transportation Research, Pratson painstakingly details trade patterns, shipping routes and the shortest paths across the oceans to assess the potential impact of closing any of the 13 chokepoints he identified around the world. He used 2019 data as that’s the most recent year in which trade could be considered “normal” before Covid-19 disrupted global commerce, and ran the analysis on commerce between non-neighbouring countries because those that share a border are likely to use land routes.Around 1,000 miles northeast of the Malacca Strait, swathes of the South China Sea are claimed by no less than seven nations, making military conflict the most obvious risk. “The chokepoints estimated to carry the most trade in terms of both total value and total weight are the Malacca Strait and South China Sea,” Pratson writes. The South China Sea alone carries trade equivalent to 5 percent of global GDP, which would make it the fourth-largest economy in the world.Exactly how much trade transits the South China Sea is a much debated point. The Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies estimated the value at $3.4 trillion for 2016, 36 percent less than other assessments for the same time period. Pratson puts it at $4.1 trillion for 2019, with $3.9 trillion going via the Malacca Strait. There’s some overlap, because goods pass through multiple sea lanes on the way to their final destination.

Unlike in the past, Goyal said, the Reserve Bank of India and the finance ministry are working together to push the growth of the country.The government has taken a series of measures to boost economic growth and now India has become the fifth-largest economy in the world. The rupee has stabilised now, otherwise it used to depreciate at a rate of 3-3.5 per cent annually, he said. After the Modi government came to power in 2014, the rate of depreciation has come down to about 1.5 per cent. "In the next 10 years, this will reduce further to about 0.5-0.75 per cent. My personal belief is that after 8-10 years, the rupee will start appreciating and with that, the Indian economy will grow further at a faster rate," he added.

You will get all the troubles on the fiscal maths by Siddarth Upasani in this story here.Even when the Budget is bombarded with uncertainties, there is one area that the finance minister can bank on, for both revenue and reduction in spending. India’s banks are in their best shape and will remain so this year to give large dividends to their primary shareholder, the government, and would have no need for capital infusion.The growing health of public sector banks over the past two years has meant that the government didn’t need to earmark any funds towards the recapitalisation of the banks it owns.

The news published on the date January 11, 2024 02:32 PM IST with headline  The GST story – many hits, few misses is: 
 The establishment of GST tribunals is a matter that needs attention. The introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India on July 1, 2017, marked a significant milestone in the country's economic history. GST replaced a plethora of central and state taxes, aiming to streamline the taxation system to foster economic growth. This reform has left a remarkable impact on the Indian taxation sector, leading to an era of improved efficiency, transparency and simplicity in business operations. Introduction of GST could be said to have given impetus towards the vibrancy of the Indian economy.In the pre-GST regime, the indirect tax structure in India was fragmented. Each state had its own VAT laws to impose taxes on supply of commodities, while the central government imposed taxes on manufacture of goods and provision of services. The levying of taxes at different stages of supply chain led to a cascading effect, resulting in tax burden for consumers. The GST law addressed this issue by providing a seamless credit and uniform tax structure. The simplified tax structure under GST has reduced the compliance burden and facilitated a more business-friendly environment. Elimination of border checkposts has resulted in faster movement of goods across state borders, in line with the government vision of "One Nation, One Tax".Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdSurge In GST CollectionUnder the GST regime, 47 lakh taxpayers transitioned from service tax, VAT, and Central Excise frameworks. Currently, there are 1.4 crore registered taxpayers under GST law. Initially, the government's average monthly GST collection ranged from Rs 0.8 to 1.2 lakh crore. However, in fiscal year 2023-24, this average monthly GST collection has surged to Rs. 1.66 lakh crore. This data highlights the substantial growth in both taxpayer numbers and GST revenue since the implementation of GST.In the era of 'Digital India,' technological advancements have played a crucial role in streamlining GST. GST portal features such as auto population of purchase data in recipient GSTINs, integration of e-invoices with GST returns and generation of e-invoices/e-way bills have significantly contributed to the efficiency of the GST system. Additionally, processes such as e-filing of refunds, online appeals have further enhanced the overall functionality of GST.

 Over the decades, a wide-ranging immigration program has transformed, mostly for the better, Australian cultural and economic life. (Source: Getty Images/Bloomberg) Pre-pandemic Australia looks like hallowed ground that the contemporary economy will struggle to surpass. For local officials who aspire to take a crack at emulating a celebrated decades-long expansion, it’s important not to downgrade a vital component that's become radioactive: immigration. The country's politicians are showing a worrying lapse in memory.As much as any other factor, population growth contributed to the 30-year stretch without a recession that ended in 2020. The country's performance was “flattered,” in the words of former Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe, by rising headcount. A mining boom fueled by China's go-go years, the dramatic economic reforms of the 1980s — and some luck — have tended to get the credit. This misses a fundamental ingredient, and it’s too bad.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdAussies loved the attention that came with that dream economic run, a happy state that was feted by think tanks and idealised in the corridors of the Federal Reserve. (There was also an unhealthy degree of back-patting at home.) Will that golden era be replicated in the post-Covid world?For starters, current leaders need the stomach to stare down one of the country's outbursts of populist aversion to rising numbers of arrivals. Wrestling with a mid-term slump in opinion polls, the center-left Labor government recently declared it wants substantial cuts. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese pledged to crack down on student visas and tighten conditions for temporary visas available to skilled migrants. It's not long ago that employers were crying out for talent from abroad. Border restrictions during the pandemic slowed immigration, as they did in many countries. Shortages needed to be alleviated.Some desire to recalibrate is understandable. There has been a big intake: In the last fiscal year to June 30, there were 518,000 new arrivals, according to the Centre for Population in Canberra. The increase was the most on record. The population has climbed greatly over the decades, almost doubling since 1980 to approach 27 million. There is an inevitable strain on resources. Contrary to images of outback ruggedness popular in books and films, Australia is one of the most urbanised societies. Most residents are crammed into a handful of cities along the southeast coastline. Backlash flares from time to time, some of it nativist and emanating from right-wing talk radio. The surge has been blamed for squeezing an already tight housing market that has seen rents soar in the major cities. Other arguments reflect genuine concern about environmental strain.

The news published on the date January 09, 2024 03:08 PM IST with headline  Evergreening of loans – Is RBI justified in its actions?  is: 
 Many companies have been raising funds through external commercial borrowings (although rates abroad have also risen) to retire more expensive Indian loans. Recently, the Reserve Bank of India (the “RBI”) issued a circular restricting Regulated Entities (“REs”), including banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (“NBFCs”), from making investments in Alternative Investment Funds (“AIFs”) that, in turn, have investments in debtor companies. A debtor company is one in which the RE currently has or, during the preceding 12 months, had a loan or investment exposure. The circular aims to address concerns relating to the possible evergreening of loans to borrowers through AIFs.Evergreen loans simply refer to endless loans. In some cases, REs have been taking minority stakes in AIFs, and AIFs have used the invested capital to subscribe to debentures or other instruments of debtor companies. The funds so received by the debtor companies are used to repay the earlier unpaid loans of REs. This helps REs show a lower percentage of Non-Performing Assets in their books.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdSome of the key and onerous aspects of the circular are:1] REs must not make an investment in any scheme of an AIF, which plans to make or has made downstream investments either, directly or indirectly, in a debtor company of the RE.2] If an AIF scheme, in which an RE is already an investor, makes a downstream investment in any debtor company, then the RE must liquidate its investment in the scheme within thirty (30) days from the date of the downstream investment by the AIF.

 Like its Western counterparts, Comac has benefited from government support and guaranteed orders from state-backed airlines. (Source: Bloomberg) For more than a decade, China’s state-owned aircraft manufacturer has plugged away at developing commercial jets. Until recently, efforts to sell foreign customers on an alternative to the US-European duopoly of Boeing Co. and Airbus SE showed little progress. Then the American giant messed up again.The blowout of a side panel in a 737 Max operated by Alaska Airlines starts to make Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd. look like an option worth exploring. Airlines tend to share orders between Airbus and Boeing to ensure they’re not entirely reliant on one supplier and to play the manufacturers off against each other. With the latest troubles, a third choice makes sense. Better known as Comac, the Shanghai-based company has already secured more than 1,000 orders, but they’re largely from domestic customers like China Eastern Airlines Corp.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdForeign operators have stuck with Boeing and Airbus for decades, largely because the two are known entities and airlines are risk averse when it comes to shelling out billions of dollars for the single most-important piece of equipment required to run their businesses. New entrants tend to fail because the cost of developing a new plane from scratch is sky high, while customers and investors are unlikely to pony up the capital needed until a proven product can be demonstrated.Like its Western counterparts, Comac has benefited from government support and guaranteed orders from state-backed airlines. With funding secured, all Comac needed to do was build a viable and reliable plane. It took a while, but its C919 — a counterpart to A320 and Boeing 737 jets — finally went into commercial service in May last year. Now, it’s plying theShanghai-Chengdu route for China Eastern and the carrier has since upped its order. From an initial five, the company in September announced it would buy a further 100, worth $9.9 billion at list prices.It’s unlikely that major Boeing customers like United Airlines Holdings Inc, Ryanair Holdings Plc or Emirates Airline will be dropping the Arlington, Virginia-based manufacturer in favor of Comac anytime soon. But a key advantage that had secured the American aerospace firm’s market position — safety and reliability — is starting to look weak.

 The health insurance space has been a tough one. Dear Reader,Dr Devi Shetty-promoted Narayana Hrudayalaya has got the insurance regulator IRDAI’s permission to test out an integrated healthcare cum insurance model, or managed healthcare. This will not be the first time that a healthcare provider has dabbled in health insurance. Apollo Hospitals too had promoted an insurance business under Apollo Munich that was eventually sold to HDFC and folded under its HDFC Ergo general insurance arm. Max India sold its stake in Max Bupa to True North and the health insurance is now called Niva Bupa.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdWhile the idea may seem an old one, the earlier ones were seen more as extensions of the group’s investments in the healthcare sector, such as diversifying into health insurance, diagnostics or pharmacy chains. These businesses would be incubated by the main holding company, but eventually have a business model independent of the parent. That is, the diagnostics and pharmacy would not necessarily be captive to the hospital chains owned by the parent. That made sense as the outside market opportunity was much larger and these businesses could become independent.Over the years, it’s been a mixed picture. Extensions such as pharmacy chains and diagnostic chains have had to compete with stiff competition from new entrants, especially after a funding deluge saw many standalone entities emerge. The health insurance space has been a tough one anyway. But primarily, the hospitals business itself calls for significant resources, both managerial and capital. That need has increased even more, as VC/PE funds are making a beeline for the sector, investing in hospitals – chains and standalone ones. Many have exited or pared down their stakes in these ventures. The sector is seeing consolidation and hospitals are also resorting to increasing their investments in a cluster rather than spreading out to different markets.Again, private capital’s interest in hospitals is not new, but the pace and level of investments is significant in this round. There may be a funding winter for startups, but mention hospitals and the purses open by magic. The legacy hospital chains must be wary of these developments as a well-funded competition with pressure from investors on the performance front could see more demand for the same pool of patients.

Like her last two terms, the mandate lacks credibility. There was neither much contest nor popular participation in this election.Bangladesh is facing serious concerns on the economic front. The artificial stability on the political front may not help the cause.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdIn a rerun of the 2014 election, the principal Opposition party, Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), opted out of the 2024 election. Hundreds of their leaders and activists were rotting in jail. The third largest Jatiya Party entered a seat-sharing arrangement with the League. Even the 40 percent voter turnout was equivalent to 2014’s tally.The election was held in 299 of the 300 seats. Official results are not yet available in full. According to local media, the League should win around 225 seats. Jatiya Party might bag 11 with the blessings of the Awami League. The remaining 55-60 would go to the independent candidates.There are many ways to analyse the results. The low turnout would boost the morale of the Opposition. Bangladesh has been witnessing rising social tension and violence for some time. The trend may consolidate.
 
The news published on the date January 08, 2024 11:06 AM IST with headline  An Expanded BRICS: The frenemies who could challenge the West’s sanctions regime is: 
 Far from papering over existing cracks in the BRICS grouping, the the addition of new members has just increased the number of disputes. (Source: Bloomberg) The BRICS grouping has long been distinguished by a consistent failure to live up to potential. The internal contradictions are crippling: Divergent interests between members make it difficult to develop any shared policies. Brazil, Russia and South Africa are commodity exporters; India and China are importers. Brazil, India and South Africa are democracies; Russia and China only pretend to be. And India and China, as everyone knows, don’t exactly see eye to eye on anything.This year, the bloc has decided to take the bold step of enhancing those internal divisions manifold by admitting five new members: Ethiopia, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. It was supposed to be six; but Argentina’s new president declared, in his usual restrained manner, that he had no intention of “allying with communists” and so won’t get a second Latin American member. BRICS made up for that by admitting four members from that tranquil zone of stability and co-operation, the Middle East, and a fifth, Ethiopia, that’s barely a year out of a devastating civil war.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdMore importantly, while the Emiratis and the Saudis are partners, and Riyadh appears happy to give the regime in Cairo billions to stay friendly, Iran and Saudi Arabia have spent the past decade or so struggling for influence in the region. Iran backs the Houthi rebels in Yemen, for example, against whom Saudi Arabia has fought a long and ineffectual war. And there is anger in Ethiopia over the government’s silence on the years of abuse (and, allegedly, “mass killings”) that human rights groups say Saudi border guards have inflicted on Ethiopian migrants. Far from papering over existing cracks in the BRICS grouping, the the addition of new members has just increased the number of disputes.It may be hard to see how a group that has always struggled to get much done will be able to create anything substantive if they don’t even like each other. Still, with the addition of the new members, there are a couple of domains that bear watching. There’s a chance that, in these very specific fields, BRICS+ might prove to be unusually effective.One is infrastructure finance. The only real institution it has managed to build is the Shanghai-based New Development Bank. The “BRICS bank,” which is currently led by former Brazilian president Dilma Roussef, has a mandate to lend to infrastructure projects that the rest of the multilateral architecture ignores. One of the few things the existing BRICS members do agree on is that emerging economies need more project finance. Plus, they want that cash disbursed according to norms designed locally, not in the West.

This solidifies India as a promising investment choice among emerging markets.India's MSCI Emerging Markets index spiked in eight years, leaping from 7 percent to 17.1 percent.

India's positioning in EM portfolios remains relatively light, but its growing size is making its markets more relevant for global funds. Favourable conditions such as expected political stability, a rising investment cycle, and a peaking US dollar create an ideal scenario for higher foreign flows.After a significant outflow of $33 billion from 2H21-1H22, FPI flows have reversed, with the highest inflows observed in the last 11 years. India's rising weight in EMs has contributed to these increased flows, with its neutral weight in the benchmark MSCI EM rising by 3.5 percentage point over the past six quarters. However, analysis shows that India's relative position in large EM active funds are closer to neutral now, rather than significantly above the average. Therefore, the potential for FPIs to take a larger position could become a crucial driver for future flows, Jefferies note added.

 How long will the hangover last? That will depend on the kind of hangover. Dear Reader, For the markets, 2024 started with a hangover, which is hardly a surprise, given the wild partying that had begun even before Powell gave the green light for the festivities. Powell’s dovish cooing led to a celebration, the likes of which hadn’t been seen in a long time—the Bank of America survey of fund managers for December 2023 said investors were the highest stock overweight since February 2022, the highest bond overweight in 15 years, the lowest cash overweight since April 2021 and the highest commodity underweight since June 2017. In that context, the morning after’s hangover has been rather mild.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdThe real questions are: is the Goldilocks 2024 scenario of a soft landing with low inflation still intact? And how much of that has been baked into stock prices? It is the uncertainty around these questions that the markets are grappling with. As Moneycontrol Pro’s independent research team put it, ‘investors today are a happy but a nervous lot, not savouring the fruits of their investment for fears of an imminent correction’. After analysing the markets in depth, they concluded that ‘while bears might fight to make a comeback, by the end of the year, the bulls are likely to have the last laugh.’Second thoughts about the rally were triggered by the minutes of the last Fed meeting, which, as this FT story (free to read for Moneycontrol Pro subscribers) points out, added to doubts that the US central bank is poised to begin cutting interest rates as early as March, dashing market expectations. Our columnist Ananya Roy points to inflated valuations and advises caution for investors even as they ride the rally. What that translates into, at a practical level, is that 2024 could be the year of alpha stock pickers rather than macro chasers, as S Krishnakumar, the founder of Lion Capital, told us in this interview. You’ll find some of these alpha stock picks from my research colleagues below.Some incoming data in the new year have been upsetting. Germany’s retail inflation, for instance, moved up to an annualised 3.7 percent in December, up from 3.2 percent in the previous month. Retail inflation in France too was higher. Inflation according to the Eurozone consumer price index too came in higher for December, albeit a bit lower than forecast.

In the amended KYC master direction, the central bank defines PEPs as "individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent public functions by a foreign country, including the heads of states/governments, senior politicians, senior government or judicial or military officers, senior executives of state-owned corporations and important political party officials".Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdThe new rules also include a person who is entrusted by a foreign country with a public function.

Today’s investors of India are not the guaranteed return-seeking boomers or even anxiety ridden paycheck-counting middle agers but young millennials and Gen Z who have yet to see a debilitating economic downcycle or a crisis (the pandemic doesn’t count anymore).December’s record high demat account additions is a fallout of this demographic. My colleague Ravindra Sonavane brings all the details here. Will it sustain? The jury is still out but Indians are not backing away from dipping their toes into the stock market.

 The developed nations of the West have extensive social security systems, which result in both government revenues and expenditure being high as a proportion of GDP. The standard advice given to the Indian government is that it must increase its tax to GDP ratio.

It says India’s tax gap, or the difference between taxes legally owed and taxes collected, is estimated at 5 percent of GDP.

 Pakistan is facing a severe economic downturn, political repression, and growing public anger against its high-handed policy in the country’s hinterland. Pakistan is a nation of distractions. Its landscape of distractions has been meticulously constructed by its military-dominated establishment, steering focus away from pressing domestic issues of everyday concerns. This carefully crafted playbook is aimed at ensuring that Pakistanis are distracted towards archaic issues of trivial significance in their daily lives and aspirations, thereby shielding the powers-that-be from public scrutiny on critical issues. Pakistan is facing a severe economic downturn, political repression, and growing public anger against its high-handed policy in the country’s hinterland such as Balochistan and tribal districts. To fade these issues into the background, the Pak establishment orchestrates familiar diversionary tactics, exemplified by the designation of January 5 as Kashmir’s Right to Self-Determination Day in recent years.However, this serves more as a smokescreen than genuine concern for the region where it has engaged in proxy war since decades wherein thousands have perished in its efforts to destabilise India. This distraction provides the Pakistani establishment with the necessary bandwidth to craft and control the national narrative by camouflaging internal strife and evading accountability. As such, January 5 joins a roster of distraction dates, including February 5 (Kashmir Solidarity Day) and October 27 (Kashmir Black Day), which have lost significance due to evolving realities in Jammu and Kashmir.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdPolitical Scene in J&KThe altered political landscape of Jammu and Kashmir, reshaped within the Indian union, constitutionally approved and judicially stamped re-arrangement, has rendered these designated days increasingly symbolic. Consequently, its miniscule political constituency stands obliterated in the region and exposed to the local people for their nefarious role in keeping the region embroiled in ever continuing cycle of violence.Moreover, United Nations’ resolutions, like the UNCIP’s resolutions of 1948 and subsequent agreements, remain unfulfilled due to Pakistan’s dismissal of conditions laid therein. It may be recalled that the UN Commission for India and Pakistan (UNCIP) adopted a supplementary resolution on January 5, 1949, to its earlier resolution of August 13, 1948, laying down principles for the plebiscite in J&K, subject to the fulfilment subject to certain conditions by India and Pakistan. Interestingly, the foremost condition laid down by UNCIP Resolution (Part II (A)(1)(2)) of August 13, 1948, included the withdrawal of the “tribesmen and Pakistan nationals not normally resident therein who have entered the State for the purpose of fighting” from J&K, including Gilgit-Baltistan, as their presence constituted “a material change in the situation”. It is a historical fact that the Pakistani establishment rejected these conditions forthwith and never took any practical steps towards fulfilling any of the parameters laid down in the resolution.

 Quantum MF believes that with India's resilient economy and earnings growth the slightly expensive equity valuations will become reasonable. Dear Reader,The uncertain tone in the minutes of the US Federal Open Market Committee’s December meeting has poured cold water on investor euphoria of rate cuts. Indeed, the markets overreacted to the dovish commentary by the Fed expecting “too much too soon”, on rate cuts.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdWhat’s unsettling global financial markets is that the minutes do not shed any light on when rate cuts could commence. Worse, there is still some uncertainty and lack of conviction that inflation has been conquered, states this FT article that points to rates remaining high for some time. Elucidating this is the statement by Richmond Fed president Thomas Barkin, a voting member of the FOMC this year, “…I fear more will have to happen on the demand side, whether organically or through Fed action, to convince price-setters that the inflation era is over.”It is not surprising therefore that US financial markets reversed the trends seen at the close of 2023! Equities have remained subdued while bond yields started to climb again, after closing below 4 per cent in 2023. Markets are perhaps finding a balance from their earlier assumptions of early and rapid pace of rate cuts! In fact, most analysts now point to June for the first rate cut, as opposed to March that was envisaged earlier. Perhaps, it is the “no-bust cycle” that is worrisome. In another FT article (specially for MCPro subscribers), columnist Ruchir Sharma highlights how when interest rates rose so sharply, it seemed almost certain that indebted businesses would fail quickly, consumers would hunker down immediately, markets would tank, recession would strike, and the world would face a classic bust in 2023.

So don't expect any policy initiatives."Sitharaman, while presenting Budget 2021-22, had announced the privatisation of public sector banks (PSBs) as part of the disinvestment drive to garner Rs 1.75 lakh crore.The FM had then said that other than IDBI Bank the government proposes to take up the privatisation of two public sector banks and one general insurance company in 2021-22. But this announcement wasn’t followed up."Every government makes the decisions at the right time. So, I don't think that anything is going to happen before the general elections," a finance ministry official said.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdCurrent situation of public sector banksIndustry experts believe that banks are currently in good stead and earning profits."There is no chance to touch issues like bank privatisation in the interim Budget. Banks’ situation is quite favourable thanks to the earning improvements of banks. Some banks have also been able to raise good funds and their capital position appears quite nice, it's in profitable mode, said former finance secretary Subhash Chandra Garg.India's banking sector, in the July-September FY24 quarter, saw double-digit profits and improvement in asset quality, according to a Moneycontrol analysis. Additionally, some major banks reported a contraction in their net interest margins (NIM).Among major banks, the State Bank of India (SBI) reported a net profit of Rs 14,330 crore in the July-September FY24 quarter. Bank of Baroda’s (BoB) profit after tax stood at Rs 4,253 crore while Punjab National Bank reported a 327 percent rise in net profit at Rs 1,756 crore for the latest July-September quarter."The public sector banks have served as the backbone of the financial sector in India and will continue to do so. With rapid economic growth in the country, private sector banks have more than enough space to explore and flourish," said Charan Singh Non-Executive Chairman of Punjab & Sind Bank.Singh said banks are in a very healthy situation in India and are expected to continue that trend. The interest rate cycle can change in 2024-25 but given the buffers, banks will be able to fend for themselves.
 
The news published on the date January 03, 2024 06:07 PM IST with headline  Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | Tech trouble is: 
 The market is eagerly awaiting AI's impact in terms of numbers, whether positive or negative, in 2024. The tech sector began 2024 on a sombre note. On the first day of trading, Apple experienced a significant setback, losing $100 billion in market capitalization and triggering a 1.6 percent drop in the Nasdaq. The 3.6 percent loss in Apple's stock value was attributed to Barclays downgrading the stock to "underweight." The downgrade cited disappointing iPhone 15 sales and a bleak outlook for Apple's hardware business.Beyond Apple, Intel also played a role in the index's decline, falling 4.9 percent along with other chip makers. This downturn followed an announcement by Dutch semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker ASML, stating it would restrict shipments of certain technology to China at the Dutch government's request.The repercussions extended to the Indian market, where the IT sector experienced a more than 2 percent fall on Wednesday. Despite a recent rally in IT stocks in India over the past three months, the Nasdaq drop and the upcoming earnings season are expected to limit upward movements in the sector.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdBroking firms are exercising caution due to the recent outperformance making IT stocks more expensive. Bloomberg data reveals that the Nifty IT index trades at 26.4 times its one-year forward earnings, a 31 percent premium to the benchmark Nifty and significantly above the five-year mean.Expectations for the IT sector remain subdued, with most analysts anticipating low single-digit revenue growth in the December quarter. This is attributed to reduced discretionary spending by clients and higher-than-expected furloughs during the quarter.The hiring outlook for IT companies in 2024 is also conservative, withreports suggesting a reduction in freshers hiring from 2.3 lakh in the previous year to 1.55 lakh in FY2023-24. Notably, Infosys has decided not to visit college campuses for hiring freshers. Major companies like Google, Amazon, Meta, and Apple have also slowed their hiring in India, with job openings decreasing by 90 percent since 2022.

 While global equities did well, domestic equity investors earned good returns too with large, mid and small caps returning splendid returns. Dear reader,A year ago, investors held on to the edge of their seats, waiting for a recession to envelop the Western world in its vicious embrace. Speculation was mainly focused on whether it would be mild or strong. The data on charts was pointing to it as a near certainty. But that recession never came. Sure, growth slowed down, interest rates tightened but not enough to throttle growth to an extent that equities wilted under pressure.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdWhile global equities did well, domestic equity investors earned good returns too with large, mid and small caps returning splendid returns. The latter two categories delivered much higher returns than the first one. Even gold delivered a positive return. The tightening of interest rates during 2023 meant that long-tenure holdings suffered but shorter-tenure instruments earned more. Some deft portfolio management should have ensured good returns for fixed-income investors too. Healthy actual user demand even supported real estate prices in some if not all markets. This was a year when serendipity could easily be mistaken for investing smarts.While it’s alright to bask in a good year of returns, this is as good a time as any to revisit your assumptions, goals and portfolio allocation. If you were reasonably weighted towards small and mid-cap stocks at the start of the year, then those weights have risen considerably now. If you deliberately choose to stay the course, understanding the risks and opportunities that come with it, then that’s fine. But if you assess that the portfolio weightages could give you grief if markets enter a correction phase, or worse a drawdown, then it’s time to reallocate. And this exercise is independent of what happens to the market, specific to your own situation.What can we expect to happen in 2024? The experience of financial soothsayers from a year ago makes one wary of forming any firm opinions. Once your portfolio is rigged to withstand the volatility that’s a norm in equity markets, the right approach will be to be flexible about what can happen.

The news published on the date December 29, 2023 12:11 PM IST with headline  Global Economy 2024: Positives in macro outlook outweighing uncertainties, India in a position to dream big is: 
 India’s economic performance has been better than expected. “Macroeconomists were created to make weather forecasters gain credibility” goes one joke. “Economists have successfully predicted 9 out of the last 5 recessions” is another dig at the predictive ability of the macroeconomics discipline. Beyond the humour, it points to the obvious complexity of interaction between hundreds of related variables in a complicated geopolitical scenario.Despite the obvious risks involved in speculating about the future in the economic domain, many brave economists undertake foolhardy tasks of making year-end projections and this is one such attempt.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove Ad2023 In A NutshellPerhaps as a nod to the recession predicting joke, the global economy performed far better in 2023 than most predicted. The global economy is set to outperform the consensus forecast by nearly one percentage point, with the global GDP growth rate predicted to be in the range of 2.7 percent to 3 percent. This was led by strong growth in the United States, which outperformed consensus forecasts by nearly two percentage points, with GDP growth rate set to hit 2.4 percent.The strong GDP growth rate corresponded with lowering of unemployment rate to below pre-pandemic levels in most countries. Inflation in most countries remained stubbornly high, though it is significantly lower than the decadal highs witnessed in 2022. This is partly due to falling commodity prices in 2023. Oil prices (brent crude) decreased from about $110/barrel in mid-2022 to around $75/barrel in Dec-2023. Core inflation (minus food and oil), however, has remained sticky.

 In a country as large as India, equity market capitalisation and listed corporate profits are barely representative of the economy’s overall health. Dear Reader, The Panorama newsletter is sent to Moneycontrol Pro subscribers on market days. It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. The year 2023 is set to close on a euphoric note for equity investors in India. Year-till-date, the MSCI India has returned about 19 per cent in USD terms, reflecting the investor’s conviction in uninterrupted economic recovery post-pandemic and robust economic growth.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdBut are stock markets truly representative of economic growth? A look at equity market returns across several other emerging markets (EM) are thought-provoking. The MSCI country-wise year-till-date 2023 (as of 27th December) data shows that Poland, Hungary and Greece topped the list, with returns of 48 per cent, 46 per cent and 45 per cent respectively in USD terms. Even equities in Brazil and Peru fared better than India!Does this mean that the economies of all these countries are growing at breakneck speed? Not really. Perhaps, it is the relative growth or an improvement in growth that is being mirrored in equity markets. For instance, Brazil’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth, albeit lower than some of its peers, is forecast to grow by 2.3 per cent in 2023, which is an improvement from negative growth rates seen even in pre-pandemic years. Growth in Hungary too is expected to pick up in 2024.Again, while the travails of the US and the UK economies are grabbing headlines and the poor fiscal health of the Eurozone is also widely known, stock markets seem to be in the pink of health.What can be said with certainty is that investors are betting on equities as an asset class to beat inflation that has reigned high for long. Within this, emerging markets hold greater promise for returns, on the back of higher consumption potential that could seep into corporates, translating into revenue and profit growth. Further, signals of a rate pivot by US Fed have taken the sheen off bonds, which may drive more flows into equities.

 Increasing passive funds tracking India augurs well for higher investments, particularly from nations with a substantial equity investment culture. Dear Reader, Indian markets are gradually attracting the attention of global investors. While domestic investments have shown resilience since the pandemic, foreign investors influence short-term market trends.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdThe extent of Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) involvement in India depends upon the performance of their markets and interest rates. Foreign investors tend to withdraw funds from emerging markets when interest rates are high. Conversely, investors channel funds into emerging markets in a risk-off scenario with falling interest rates and buoyant equity markets.The pattern of FII investments in India has been anything but consistent. The fiscal year 2020-21 peaked as FIIs infused Rs 2,74,031.96 crore post-pandemic, capitalising on excess funds released through quantitative easing. However, the subsequent two years witnessed withdrawals amounting to Rs 1,40,009 crore in 2021-22 and Rs 37,631 crore in 2022-23, coinciding with a rise in interest rates. As interest rates reach their zenith and the Indian economy gains traction while China experiences a slowdown, FIIs have injected Rs 1,87,920 crore into India in the current fiscal year, 2023-24.A significant portion of the investments flowing into the country emanates from passive funds. Asset management companies prefer the cost-effective index fund route over maintaining a comprehensive asset management team for investment oversight. Consequently, increasing passive funds tracking India augurs well for higher investments, particularly from nations with a substantial equity investment culture.

He had spent hours discussing dot plots and all he could think of saying was ‘’The plot thickens’’. He put his head in his hands and groaned.

 In November, U.S. prices dropped for the first time in over 3.5 years, reducing the annual inflation rate below 3%, increasing expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in March. U.S. prices fell in November for the first in more than 3-1/2 years, pushing the annual increase in inflation further below 3%, and boosting financial market expectations of an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve next March.The report from the Commerce Department on Friday also showed underlying inflation pressures continuing to subside. Cooling inflation left more income at the disposal of households, helping to underpin consumer spending and the overall economy as the year winds down.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdThis was yet another data set showcasing the durability of the economic expansion, thanks to a resilient labor market. The economy has defied dire predictions of recession from economists and some business executives going back to late 2022."(Fed) Chair (Jerome) Powell couldn't have asked for a better present this year," said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. "So far at least, the endgame is turning out better than the Fed or nearly anyone could have imagined at the start of the year. While the Fed won't rush into cutting rates, it's likely now just a matter of time."Inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, fell 0.1% last month, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said. That was the first monthly decline in the PCE price index since April 2020 and followed an unchanged reading in October.Food prices edged down 0.1% and energy prices dropped 2.7%. In the 12 months through November, the PCE price index increased 2.6% after rising 2.9% in October. October marked the first time since March 2021 that the annual PCE price index was below 3%.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PCE price index unchanged on the month and rising 2.8% year-on-year.Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index rose 0.1% in November, matching October's gain.Story continues below AdvertisementThe so-called core PCE price index advanced 3.2% year-on-year, the smallest rise since April 2021, after increasing 3.4% in October. The Fed tracks the PCE price measures for its 2% inflation target.The government reported on Thursday that core PCE inflation increased at a 2.0% annualized rate in the third quarter. That, combined with November's mild gain, put the six-month core PCE inflation rate at 1.9%.Monthly inflation readings of 0.2% on a sustainable basis are needed to bring inflation back to the Fed's target, economists say. Financial markets saw a roughly 75% chance of a rate cut at the Fed's March 19-20 policy meeting, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.Subsiding inflation is brightening the mood for many Americans, with a separate report from the University of Michigan on Friday showing consumer sentiment soaring in December, reversing all declines from the previous four months.President Joe Biden, whose popularity has been hurt by unhappiness over the high cost of living, welcomed the news."This reflects the hard work we did together to fix our supply chains and the surge of Americans into the workforce. It's remarkable progress," Biden said in a statement.Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar fell against basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.CONSUMER SPENDING RISESThe U.S. central bank held rates steady last week and policymakers signaled in new economic projections that the historic monetary policy tightening engineered over the last two years is at an end and lower borrowing costs are coming in 2024. Since March 2022, the Fed has hiked its policy rate by 525 basis points to the current 5.25%-5.50% range.With the labor market still fairly tight, wages jumped 0.6% last month, more than offsetting the drag on personal income from decreases in government aid, including food stamps, social security and Medicaid. Personal income rose 0.4%.The saving rate ticked up to 4.1% from 4.0% in the prior month, which bodes well for spending.Income at the disposal of households after accounting for inflation and taxes rose 0.4% after gaining 0.3% in October.That allowed Americans to open their wallets at the start of the holiday shopping season. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.2% last month after rising 0.1% in October.When adjusted for inflation, overall consumer spending increased 0.3% after nudging up 0.1% in October. The pick up in the so-called real consumer spending added to data this week, including single-family housing starts and building permits, in suggesting the economy was regaining speed after appearing to falter at the start of the fourth quarter.That was reinforced by a third report from the Commerce Department's Census Bureau showing orders for durable goods jumped 5.4% in November, recouping October's 5.1% drop.Though a fourth report from the Census Bureau showed new home sales plunging 12.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 590,000 units in November, a one-year low, the drop is likely temporary amid a dearth of previously owned houses on the market. Mortgage rates continue to decline from 23-year highs, which should help new home sales.Gross domestic product growth estimates for the fourth quarter range from as low as a 1.1% annualized rate to as high as a 2.8% pace. The economy grew at a 4.9% rate in the third quarter."The U.S. economy is doing well heading into 2024," said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

The enormous degree of opaqueness in the methodology makes it challenging to quantify the impact of qualitative factors on credit ratings.

 Here are a few points in which Raghuram Rajan has been wrong about India’s economic path. Abhishek Banerjee & Karuna GopalIt was one morning in December 2022. The two men sat side by side, under the winter sun. India will be “lucky to get 5 percent growth” next year, Raghuram Rajan told Rahul Gandhi. The next day it was all over the newspapers. Coming from Rajan, it was already as good as true. But this was not the first time that the media had taken either of these two individuals more seriously than it should have. ‘If Rajan exits, so will billions in investment’ ran one headline in 2016. That was when his term as governor of the Reserve Bank was about to end. Rajan also made headlines in June 2015 when he predicted that a 1930s-style Great Depression was coming. What happened to that?Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdFrom 2013 to 2018, Rajan “predicted” doom for the global economy at the rough rate of once a year. Each time, the media covered him. The media never learns. But this time, something new happened. Something that rarely happens to star economists. People followed up. They made clippings of his “lucky to get 5 percent” speech and began posting it online. Every time India posted its high growth numbers, the videos went viral. A dazzling 7.8 percent in the first quarter of the 2023-24 fiscal year, and 7.6 percent for the second.The world is cheering on India. And people online are laughing at Raghuram Rajan.And so, it is for the first time ever, that a cornered Rajan has been forced to defend himself. In recent interviews, he said that all these people are trolls. He says it is an organised effort against him. But it is not. It is just common people speaking truth to an economist they now see as more political than academic. For that matter, Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra, during which Rajan originally made these comments, was also an organised effort. The question is whether the critics are wrong, not whether they are organised.

 The market size of the online gaming industry is estimated at $2.5 bn in FY24 which is expected to grow by 25 percent next fiscal. The online gaming industry, which is currently taking a hit on margins due to the 28 percent Goods and Services Tax (GST) in effect since October 1, is aiming to incentivise players to park their money on the platforms for a longer duration and change user behaviour over the next one year in order to reduce the impact on their net profitability, multiple industry players said.The GST Council has revised the rate on online gaming from 18 percent to 28 percent on full face value effective October 1, 2023.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove Ad“It’s a sizable increase in the GST rate. The GST burden is hitting the EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation. It is the alternate method of measuring profitability in net income.) positivity of companies. Over the next year the online gaming companies aim at changing user behaviour to keep deposits for longer to reduce the tax incidence. The EBITDA positivity depends on changes in user and transaction behaviour over the next one year,” an industry source told Moneycontrol.Every time a deposit is made by a player on an online gaming platform, 28 percent GST is payable on the face value. For taxation, the deposit duration is important, not the gaming time. If the same amount of money continues on a platform, the tax will be one time. In a month if a person withdraws and deposits three times, 28 percent GST is applicable every time a deposit is made, leading to a high tax incidence. Thus, if the user's behaviour is such that they keep money for long on an online gaming platform, the company gets more revenue for the tax paid.“The industry currently is absorbing the higher GST and not passing it on to the players. In the books of online gaming companies, it will reflect a huge hit. So, the companies may provide incentives or bonuses to users for parking their money for a long on the platform. There may be different operational ways, we will experiment with how to change user behaviour. Then the EBIDTA positivity will grow. Companies are already experimenting with it and the impact will be seen after a year,” another industry source told Moneycontrol.

RBI "strongly disagreed" with the IMF's assessment.The IMF has reclassified India's "de facto" exchange rate regime to "stabilised arrangement" from "floating" for December 2022 to October 2023. According to RBI, the IMF's reclassification is “unjustified," the report said.RBI officials, in their meetings with the IMF, said the forex interventions were in line with the "best principles of transparency" and that the rupee's exchange rate continues to be market determined.In RBI’s view, IMF staff's assessment is short-term and restricted to the last six to eight months without any rationale for the same, and if a longer-term view of two to five years is taken, the IMF's assessment would fail.On the debt to GDP ratio, the IMF noted that given the shocks India has had to face, the debt-to-GDP ratio could exceed 100 percent in the medium term. Indian officials disagree. According to KV Subramanian, IMF's Executive Director for India and a former Chief Economic Adviser to the government, it "sounds extreme".

As far as battles go, the one India is waging against inflation seems without an end in sight. Not because the authorities are on the wrong track, but because of the nature of the beast: some inflation is necessary, but it needs to be controlled.

Suffice it to say that India's flexible inflation targeting framework — a target of 4 percent with a leeway of 200 basis points on either side — is now battle-hardened, having experienced a once-in-a-century pandemic, the Ukraine in war, and multiple geopolitical conflicts over the course of the last three years.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdAlso Read: RBI doubles down to ward off complacency as long rate pause gets longerWhat the Indian authorities need to do now is to make it ready to face the next big global economic challenge — climate change.

After the legalistic niceties of environmental diplomacy, the dirtier business of political maneuvering is going to consume the world’s democracies over the next 12 months. In 2024, climate will be on the ballot in a way we’ve rarely seen.Voters in countries representing more than 40 percent of the world’s population — and roughly the same share of emissions — will go to the polls between now and the end of next year. In places, that offers the prospect to break gridlocks on climate and energy policies. In others, it may offer an opportunity for a climate-denying backlash. Far too few places show a decent chance of accelerating the transition to clean energy in the way advocated by the COP28 agreement. Here’s a review of some of the key events.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdCoal and the PollsTwo of the world’s three biggest democracies face elections in the first half of 2024, but neither offers a strong prospect of change. India and Indonesia have made positive noises lately about switching to clean power. Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India has promised 500 gigawatts of renewables by 2030 and President Joko Widodo in Indonesia has signed up for a $20 billion deal to retire the nation’s coal generators early.In each case, however, coal’s deep political, economic and social roots have stymied efforts at reform. Elections aren’t likely to change that dynamic: Modi is well ahead in the polls, while the frontrunner in Jakarta, Prabowo Subianto, is essentially a continuity candidate who’s picked Widodo’s son as his running mate.
 
The news published on the date December 18, 2023 10:07 AM IST with headline  Hong Kong bankers’ uneasy dance with property tycoons is: 
 hong-kong Hong Kong dazzles with its soaring skyscrapers and swanky shopping malls, and the city has its bankers to thank. Over the years, landlords routinely relied on banks to finance ambitious projects and expected good relationships to remain. But lenders are getting nervous.Next year, close to HK$200 billion ($25.6 billion) of bank loans taken out by Hong Kong’s property developers will be due, and only 15 percent of them have been — or are close to being — refinanced, according to HSBC Holdings Plc estimates.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdWhether banks will continue lending to the business elites has become a hot issue, as commercial real estate woes plague the world’s biggest cities. In late August, New World Development Co halted a brutal slide in its bond prices after saying it had secured HK$30 billion of low-interest bank loans. The selling had been triggered by a little-known blogger who accused the builder of borrowing at 11 percent to 12 percent in private markets.Already, some lenders are stepping back from smaller, leveraged landlords. In September, Lai Sun Development Co, whose holdings include Ocean Park Marriott Hotel and the Michelin-starred Italian restaurant 8 1⁄2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana, only managed to roll over 80 percent of a HK$3.6 billion 4-year loan, originally taken out to build the Marriott resort. HSBC subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd. and DBS Group Holdings Ltd are no longer on the deal. One month later, just about 75 percent of a HK$4.2 billion loan, backed by Harborside HQ, a grade-A office building in Kowloon Bay, was refinanced.Hong Kong is not back to its old days. In a recent survey, only one in three firms expect rising business turnover next year. Office vacancies in the Central business district are at a record high. On the retail front, tourist arrivals have ramped up to a mere 60 percent of the 2018 level, while residents head north every weekend to dine and shop, taking advantage of mainland China’s deflationary environment. Retail sales are only back to 84 percent of the 2018 level, before the city got hammered by the 2019 pro-democracy movement and then Covid-19.Financial metrics aside, loan officers can tell many of the urban rejuvenation projects are on shaky ground. Hysan Development Co, the biggest landlord in Causeway Bay — once the world’s most expensive shopping district — is working on a mega development in the neighborhood, financed in early 2022 by a green loan worth HK$13 billion. The total cost, including land and construction, is estimated at HK$25 billion, while annual capital expenditure leading to the scheduled 2026 completion is expected to soak up half of Hysan’s operating cash flow.Yet Causeway Bay is a shadow of its glorious past. During a recent visit, I was amazed how empty Hysan Place, a luxury shopping and office center opened just a decade ago, was at 8 p.m. Moody’s Investors Service recently lowered its outlook to negative, citing Hysan’s elevated leverage.Kai Tak, the city’s former commercial airport that is now being developed into a prime business district, is also problematic. The area has undergone several rounds of urban planning revisions. Proposals for a monorail were set aside, while residents fought with the government over plans to build temporary public housing units. These changes were met with anemic sales, and HK$47 billion of project loans, taken out by the likes of Wheelock Properties Ltd., are due over the next two years, according to HSBC.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdGranted, Hong Kong banks have incentives not to rock the boat. Pulling loans will trigger a market meltdown, top tenants to flee, and possible fire sales and asset write-downs. This will eventually come back to bite the lenders themselves.Case in point: As of the first half, HSBC had $44 billion of commercial real estate loans booked in Hong Kong, including an $8.1 billion exposure to mainland China, which in turn accounted for almost all of the bank’s , or those that are non-performing and carry substantial credit risks. In other words, HSBC hardly put aside any credit loss provisions for their commercial real estate exposure in Hong Kong.Going into 2024, Hong Kong’s commercial bankers will have an uneasy dance with the property tycoons. They know the numbers don’t work for the city’s ambitious commercial real estate projects, but do they really want to challenge the status quo? The best hope then, is that the Federal Reserve will cut rates aggressively and a flood of liquidity will revive the financial center.Shuli Ren is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

 If growth rate is not over 6%, India will remain lower middle economy by 2047: Raghuram Rajan Former Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan said India will still remain a lower middle country if the growth rate remains at 6 per cent annually without any rise in population by 2047 (Amrit Kaal) and will be reaching the end of the demographic dividend by then.Speaking at a programme organised by Manthan here, the economist said if the country does not grow faster, it will grow older (demographically) before it gets richer, which means there is the burden of an aging population to deal with also at that point."If you do the math, at 6 per cent a year, you double every 12 years, and therefore in 24 years, we'll be four times our per capita income. Today, the per capita income in India, as you know, is just a little below $2,500 per person. multiply by four, we get $10,000 per person So if you do the math, at our current rate of growth, you know, strong as it is highest in the G20, we don't get rich but we stay lower middle income till 2047," he said.The former RBI chief said some southern states are growing with regards to population at below reproduction rate, in other words, the fertility rate has fallen below reproduction rate thus slowing the growth."In other words, we will start the process of aging at some point around that time, which leads to the alarming question if we don't grow faster, we will grow old before we grow rich, which means we all have all the burdens of an aging population to deal with also at that point," he opined.According to him, the current pace of growth is not enough to employ all those who are entering the labour force and insufficient to make the country us get rich, before it gets old.

The news published on the date December 16, 2023 12:47 PM IST with headline  Moneycontrol Pro Weekender: Jerome Powell and the Wizard of Oz is: 
 The markets firmly believe in a soft landing for the US economy. Small wonder they are raising a salute to Powell Dear Reader,Many of you may remember the movie ‘Oz the Great and Powerful’, the 2013 film prequel to Frank L Baum’s timeless classic ‘The Wonderful Wizard of Oz’, a book declared by the Library of Congress as “America’s greatest and best-loved home-grown fairytale”. The film features a small-time magician who gets swept away in a tornado to the fantasy world of Oz, where he teams up with a good witch and the humble Munchkins, Quadlings and Tinkers, to overcome the two evil witches who rule over Emerald City, the capital of Oz. While the masses believe he is the Wizard of Oz, destined to save them, the Good Witch knows he’s just a conjuror. But the magician does not lose heart, and conjures up a storm of illusion, trickery, and fireworks to defeat the evil witches.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdFed chair Jerome Powell is no less than a wizard, having beaten the twin witches of inflation and recession, perhaps with a little prodding from good witch Janet Yellen. The markets certainly believe in him—his soothing remarks post the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday has led to a huge rally in equities, in bonds and even in gold. We had written on what the Fed decision meant for investors here and had an FT story (free to read for Moneycontrol Pro subscribers) here. We advised investors on how to proceed now that markets have scaled all-time highs here and here. And we had articles on the investment themes for 2024 from FT and from our in-house independent research team. Note that our MC Pro Research team’s New Year 2023 portfolio has delivered a stunning 48 percent one-year return.Consider the evils Powell had to contend with. The first was the pandemic and the shutdowns, which led to an unprecedented injection of liquidity, both fiscal and monetary, together with a massive disruption of supply lines. When the infection abated and demand came roaring back, the upshot was a burst of inflation, initially misdiagnosed as transient. Then, the Russia-Ukraine war erupted, sending prices skywards and there was no alternative to clamping down hard on inflation. The resulting rapid rise in policy rates then sparked fears of a recession. At the same time, fiscal policy remained very loose, leading to a disconnect with tight monetary policy. Bond yields shot up. Geopolitics queered the pitch even further, raising the spectre of higher defence spending, higher investment spending on account of re-shoring, higher costs as security rather than efficiency dictated investments and trade, and a reversion to protectionism, all of which is conducive to inflation remaining high. And looming behind all this is the daunting prospect of retooling the economy to cope with climate change.Consider the longer-term context. Central banks had kept interest rates low for decades during what was known as The Great Moderation, when inflation was very low, thanks to globalisation. This had led to a bubble in asset prices, a bubble that burst spectacularly in 2008, but was inflated once again after the Global Financial Crisis, as governments and central banks pumped in liquidity. That liquidity was multiplied several times during the pandemic. Naturally, when Powell started raising interest rates, there were dire warnings of a bursting of the bubble and a rash of bankruptcies as firms couldn’t cope with high interest costs. When nothing of the sort happened despite the Fed persisting not only with rate hikes but also with liquidity tightening, pundits started worrying about a recession, but even that much-anticipated event has been indefinitely put off.There were moments when it seemed Powell was losing the plot. Indeed, he may well echo the Wizard of Oz, who said “Frightened? Child, you're talking to a man who's laughed in the face of death, sneered at doom, and chuckled at catastrophe. I was petrified.” But steering the Fed through such turbulent times is no mean feat and we shouldn’t grudge his moment when, with inflation coming down, he has been emboldened to declare victory.

 India challenges WTO panel ruling in favour of EU on ICT import duties India has appealed against a ruling of the World Trade Organization's (WTO) trade dispute settlement panel in a case filed by the European Union against New Delhi's import duties on nine information and technology products.India's move came after both regions were not able to arrive at a mutually agreeable solution (MAS)."India and the EU have negotiated to arrive at a MAS for the past seven months, but the EU has now filed for adoption of panel report on December 7 and therefore, India has appealed against it on December 8 in the WTO," Additional Secretary in the commerce ministry Peeyush Kumar told reporters here.As part of the MAS, the EU was seeking customs duty concessions on certain goods, which was not acceptable to India as it violates WTO rules.These concessions can only be given in a free trade agreement, Kumar said.In September, the two regions had asked WTO's dispute settlement body not to adopt a ruling against New Delhi's import duties on certain ICT products like mobile phones and components, base stations, integrated circuits and optical instruments till December 18, as both sides were engaged in bilateral talks to resolve the matter.The panel in April had ruled that import duties imposed by India on certain information and technology (ICT) products violate global trading norms."India notified its decision to appeal the panel report in the case brought by the European Union (EU) in 'India Tariff Treatment on Certain Goods'. The appeal was circulated to WTO members on December 14," the WTO has said in a statement.In May, India filed another appeal in a similar dispute case initiated by Japan regarding the tariff treatment that India accords to certain goods in the ICT sector.According to WTO rules, a WTO member or members can file a case in the Geneva-based multilateral body if they feel that a particular trade measure is against the norms of the WTO.The WTO's dispute settlement body (DSB) is one of the important arms. Besides monitoring global exports and import-related rules, it adjudicates trade disputes between the member countries.Bilateral consultation is the first step to resolve a dispute. If both sides are not able to resolve the matter through consultation, either of them can approach for establishment of a dispute settlement panel.The panel's ruling or report can be challenged at the WTO's appellate body.Interestingly, the appellate body is not functioning because of differences among member countries in appointing its members. Several disputes are already pending with this body, which is not functional, as the US has been blocking the appointment of the members."India hereby notifies DSB of its decision to appeal to the appellate body regarding certain issues of law covered in the panel report and certain legal interpretations developed by the panel in the dispute 'India Tariff Treatment on Certain Goods in the ICT sector'," the communication submitted by India to the WTO said.India has sought review by the appellate body of the "errors of law and legal interpretation" by the panel in its report and findings.The EU, on April 2, 2019, challenged the introduction of import duties by India on a wide range of ICT products, including mobile phones and components, base stations, integrated circuits and optical instruments.The EU had claimed that the measures appear to be inconsistent with certain provisions of the WTO. Later, Chinese Taipei and Japan also joined the dispute.Imports of these nine goods from the EU stood at USD 340.15 million in 2022.With Chinese Taipei, Kumar said, talks are on for a MAS.

Top management changes and exits are also seen at TCS and Tech Mahindra.

Key imports are petroleum products (USD 4.6 billion) and urea (USD 1.2 billion). These account for 73 per cent of imports.Other key products are propylene and ethylene polymers (USD 383 million), pet coke (USD $265 million), gypsum (USD 115 million), chemicals (USD 417 million), iron and steel (USD 62 million), and unwrought aluminium (USD 95 million)."These products will gain from FTA-led tariff elimination by India. Most are raw materials and input to industries and India has opened most such imports from other FTA partner countries," the report said.On the services side, it said, in 2022, India's service exports to Oman were worth about USD 2.8 billion, while its imports were USD 0.2 billion."India could seek increased access to the Omani market for business services and computer and information services, which Oman regularly imports. India might also negotiate for priority visas for its professionals on short-term assignments in Oman. Oman has a weak services sector and may not press for much opening of Indian markets," Srivastava said.To provide greater market access for its pharma products, India may request Oman for track approval for Indian pharma products that are already registered with the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), UK drug regulator MHRA and European Medicines Agency, it said.India's free trade agreement with the UAE has a similar proposal. India has implemented a trade agreement with the UAE in May. Both Oman and UAE are members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).India's GDP of about USD 3.5 trillion is significantly larger than Oman's GDP of USD 115 billion. This indicates that India's economy is far more extensive and diverse.With a population of 1.4 billion compared to Oman's 5 million, India represents a vast consumer market for Oman."However, Oman's higher per capita income (USD 25,060) compared to India's (USD 2,370) could mean a demand for more diversified and possibly higher-value goods and services in Oman, which India could aim to supply," Srivastava said, adding Oman might use this FTA to diversify its economy, reducing dependence on oil and gas sectors, and to develop its human resources by gaining access to India's educational and technological expertise.He added that the reduction in import duties under the CEPA will allow Indian products to enter the Omani market at competitive prices. India' diverse range of products, from pharmaceuticals and textiles to technology and agriculture, will gain a significant advantage, enhancing India's export potential.Similarly, Oman's products, particularly in sectors like oil and gas, petrochemicals, and certain types of manufactured goods, will find a more receptive market in India. Reduced import duties mean these products can be offered at more competitive prices, potentially increasing Omani exports."Beyond the immediate economic benefits, the CEPA holds considerable strategic importance for India. It serves as a gateway for India to strengthen its footprint in Middle Eastern economies. This partnership with Oman can act as a catalyst, enhancing India's geopolitical presence and fostering deeper ties with other Middle Eastern countries," he added

(Source: Bloomberg) Just as battery-powered vehicles hit a tipping point where their cost plunges below that of conventional cars, a fresh hurdle risks holding back the EV revolution: charging networks.The Biden administration’s $7.5 billion plan to build a chain of electric filling stations across the US has yet to connect a single socket, Politico reported last week. China, home to nearly two-thirds of the world’s public charging points, is still struggling to connect them in rural areas, making long cross-country drives in EVs an anxiety-inducing proposition.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdAcross the world, networks can barely keep pace with the uptake of vehicles themselves. At the COP28 climate summit in Dubai, the UK government saw fit to boast about its latest investment in boosting highway rapid chargers — but the spending in question was a paltry £70 million ($88 million).That’s a profound problem. Poor availability of charging is one of the main reasons potential EV buyers cite in holding them back from a purchase. Those consumer doubts, in turn, have encouraged a widening group of automakers to slow down their targets for going electric. This couldbecome a vicious circle, as a smaller-than-expected fleet of battery cars shrinks the future revenue pool for charging companies, which in turn pull back investment and exacerbate car-buyers’ worries about finding a plug socket.It’s a classic example of the 80-20 principle. At a guesstimate, 80 percent of the costs of EV charging are incurred in places that make 20 percent of the revenue. To fix drivers’ range anxiety, the most pressing need is for a robust network out on the highways. The expense of building in such places is far higher, though, given the additional cost of transmission lines, transformers and back-up batteries in remote areas that aren’t used to such intensive grid demand.

The news published on the date December 11, 2023 08:14 PM IST with headline  India can grow at more than 7% in FY24: Neelkanth Mishra, PM-EAC member is: 
 India is likely to see higher growth against earlier estimates of 6.5 percent as the economy is doing well due to the increase in private capital expenditure. With the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) revising the GDP growth rate estimate upwards to 7 percent in the current fiscal, Neelkanth Mishra, a member of the Prime Minister’s economic advisory council (PM-EAC), has said that India may even exceed that figure as the total factor productivity (TFP) continues to be strong due to growth in services. TFP, a measure of the total output (GDP) by the total value of inputs, is considered a key determinant of the GDP growth rate.“We can even exceed 7 percent. India’s growth estimate is based on a 1 percent growth in labour productivity, a 4 percent growth in capital formation, and a 2 percent growth in TFP. If we break down the TFP, the agriculture and industry TFP growth is unlikely to be more than 1 percent. However the aggregate TFP is strong because of services growth, thanks to domestic factors, retail trade, etc. I do not see much friction in the export of services. I do not see any risk to TFP because of global issues,” Mishra told CNBC TV18 in an interview.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdIndia is likely to see higher growth against earlier estimates of 6.5 percent as the economy is doing well due to the increase in private capital expenditure, which is not a surprise, he said.“It’s time to upgrade the trend growth because private capex has kicked in. This growth is not a surprise. The economy is doing very well. Also, the 7 percent GDP growth estimate is on the back of fiscal tightening, and the government is likely to stick to its fiscal consolidation roadmap. It is also on the back of interest rates being jacked up and tight liquidity conditions. And it is despite exports slowing very sharply. Policymakers need to worry about trade barriers,” he said.If the fiscal deficit is rising, it supports GDP growth, and if it’s shrinking, it's a drag on GDP growth. US GDP growth is supported by a doubling of the fiscal deficit. But in India, fiscal deficit is a headwind for GDP, he said. “Indian growth is despite the fiscal consolidation. It hurts GDP growth as of now,” he added.

This was a reaction to the decision by Saudi Arabia and Russia to extend their voluntary output cuts of 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) for another three months. The momentum of higher rates could not be maintained in the following weeks due to several factors.The first is the failure to maintain production quotas by members of the oil cartel now known as the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries Plus due to the addition of Russia and other allies to the group. Several members have been exceeding their listed quotas including Iran and Venezuela which are exempt due to the sanctions. Other countries like Angola and Nigeria have felt the need to produce more oil to generate enough revenues for their exchequer.The differences within the cartel came to light at the recent OPEC plus meeting where African producers were reported to be concerned over the proposed output cuts of 2.2 million bpd scheduled for the first quarter of 2024. The latest visit of Russian President Vladimir Putin to Saudi Arabia indicates the growing concern of OPEC+ leaders over the inability of the cartel to operate as a cohesive unit.

After a surprise incremental CRR (I-CRR) in August, and the spectre of OMO (open market operation) sales and regulatory action on unsecured lending, a policy without any surprises was quite welcome.

The power struggle between veterans loyal to 68-year-old Mamata and those owing allegiance to her nephew, heir-apparent and second-in-command Abhishek Banerjee, is somewhat reminiscent of the infighting between the coteries of Mulayam Singh Yadav and his son Akhilesh in Uttar Pradesh, which took a very serious turn in the politically significant state in the run-up to the 2017 elections.The Samajwadi Party was evicted from power in 2017 and Mulayam Singh Yadav is no more but the infighting carries on.

 The number of corporate types turning up at climate conferences should be taken as a positive, rather than a negative indicator. There’s a common lament echoing through the halls of Expo City Dubai, the 1,000-acre conference venue where the COP28 climate conference is being held: This event feels more like a slick trade show than an environmental summit.About 100,000 attendees — nearly three times the number who attended COP26 in Glasgow two years ago — are milling through the venue. Fossil fuel companies have more than 2,000 representatives attending — including Sultan Al Jaber, the president of the conference as well as the chief executive officer of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co, the United Arab Emirates’ state-owned petroleum business. Lavish provision of food, drink, events, and golf buggies to ferry delegates around the vast site make it feel as much like an industry conference in Las Vegas as a sobering reckoning with environmental catastrophe.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdClimate activism, meet capitalism. You two should get to know each other better.This isn’t a frivolous point. Since the industrial revolution, our civilisation has been built around fossil fuels. Fixing the resultant emissions can be likened to digging out the foundations of the global economy and resetting them on a new, cleaner footing. It’s an extraordinary stroke of luck that we now have most of the technologies needed to not only achieve this objective, but to do so at a lower cost than the carbon-intensive alternative. Getting that new economy built, however, is going to involve one of the biggest splurges of peacetime investment the world has ever seen.Just how big? To a rough approximation, the world spends between $2 trillion and $2.5 trillion a year on its energy systems, around the annual gross domestic product of France. Only in the past few years has clean power started to decisively overtake fossil fuels to take the majority share of that budget, but things still need to accelerate.

 Madhavi Arora The Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) expectedly chose to keep the repo rate unchanged at 6.50 percent, and a 5-1 on no change in the supposed stance of ‘focus on withdrawal of accommodation’.The policy tone was confident on domestic dynamics and on meeting external financing needs, with growth upgrades and comfortable inflation trends despite near-term food-led risks. The RBI reiterated that policy must continue to be actively disinflationary to ensure fuller transmission and anchoring of inflation expectations and that past hikes so far are still working their way into the economy. But overall there was a sense of comfort in the policy tone, which was no surprise given that a benign global narrative, tighter domestic system liquidity and steady easing core inflation despite stronger growth acted as a comfortable backdrop for the December MPC meeting.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdFears of financial stability risks have taken a back seat amid swift changes in global risk appetite and low volatility in FX and other asset classes. This contrasts with the previous RBI meeting in October, when UST10Y was on its way to touching 5.0 percent and global commodity prices were moving higher.Goodbye OMO sales, but active liquidity management remains a policy watchWe reckon that the policy prerogative was to ensure financial stability in the October meeting. The external dynamics were very different. We believe OMO sales were merely announced last time as a way to depict implied policy bias for higher rates and a way to offer higher risk premia to the world and to anchor INR – none of which turned out to be a worry. As we stand today, (1) a US Goldilocks scenario dominates the world narrative, UST yields have changed gears and while INR has stayed well-anchored; (2) the India-US 10Y spread has widened to ~300 bps after having seen the decadal lows of ~240bps in mid-October 2023, and (3) the average spread between weighted call money rate and repo rate has since widened to 20 bps (versus 2 bps average in September 2023. Going ahead, we expect liquidity to stay comfortable and range-bound in the near term but will likely tighten by March 2024.

 RBI MPC revised the growth projections upward, despite the downward risks from the global economy. The RBI held its last Monetary Policy Committee deliberations of 2023 during December 6-8, 2023. As expected, RBI has not deviated from its primary mandate of bringing price stability, and to tame inflation back to the official nominal anchor of 4 percent.

 According to Governor Shaktikanta Das, it would be a mistake for people to think the RBI is giving “any kind of a signal”. For an interest rate decision that could be seen coming a mile away, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had plenty to say on December 8. And while much of it was about how nothing could be said about the future course of monetary policy, a little bit seems to have crept past the Indian central bank.First and foremost, just as the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) was unanimous in its decision to leave the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent, central bank watchers were also clear that the RBI has become less hawkish since October, making the policy review "an anti-climax of sorts," according to Aurodeep Nandi, Nomura's India economist.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove Ad"In the run-up, there was considerable market uncertainty on the extent of hawkishness that the RBI would exude, particularly given the focus on tighter liquidity in the past two meetings. Instead, the RBI surprised markets by choosing to not reprise its previous hawkishness, especially through the liquidity route," Nandi added.Indeed, Governor Shaktikanta Das said in his statement that the need to conduct open market operation (OMO) sale of government bonds – to suck out excess liquidity from the banking system – that he had mentioned in October had yet to arise as conditions had tightened due to factors beyond the RBI's control.And while the governor was able to return the loose OMO cat back to the bag, his calculated decision to mention that policymakers have to be "mindful of the risk of overtightening" may have gone astray, with economists immediately latching on to it as a sign of balance and maybe even the stance of policy being changed soon.

 This year’s near-doubling of the yuan’s share as a global payments currency has largely gone unremarked because the figures are still rather modest, and forecasts of the dollar’s impending demise have so far turned out to be greatly exaggerated.Besides, the world’s attention is fixated on China’s wobbly domestic growth. The yuan as a vehicle for the nation’s geopolitical ambitions is getting sidelined, much like the tapering enthusiasm for President Xi Jinping’s $1 trillion Belt and Road project.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdYet, ignoring the yuan’s rise might be a mistake. Going by the experience of treasurers at multinational firms, Beijing’s two-decade-old project to put its own legal tender in the race for pre-eminence — and the exorbitant privilege that comes with it — seems to have got some momentum.As the Natixis SA economist Alicia Garcia Herrero wrote this week in the Financial Times, a “weak renminbi has achieved something quite impressive in 2023: a fast increase in its cross-border use.” With a 47 percent share, the US currency is still miles ahead, though if the trend sustains, the increase in the yuan’s use in global payments to 3.6 percent in October — from 1.9 percent in January — could be the starting point of the most serious challenge yet to the greenback’s dominance in international commerce.A number of things have changed. China’s 30-plus bilateral currency swap lines with other central banks that used to sit idle, are now, as Garcia Herrero notes, getting drawn in financially strapped countries like Argentina. That’s putting more yuan into circulation outside national borders. Chinese banks are increasingly lending overseas in their local currency, which works out cheaper for borrowers because of high US interest rates.
 
The news published on the date December 08, 2023 09:55 PM IST with headline  Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | Markets resonate RBI Governor Das's optimism is: 
 Shaktikanta Das Dear Reader,If charged up equity investors were looking for more fuel, they got it from the most reliable pump: the Reserve Bank of India. The central bank’s surprising optimism over growth where it raised its FY24 forecast for GDP growth by a hefty 50 basis points to 7 percent has fired up the Nifty and has given enough fodder to sustain stock market euphoria.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdTo be sure, the RBI hasn’t turned exuberant on growth today. Its statements over the past 3-4 months have indicated the comfort it derived from GDP growth, to which the second quarter GDP growth data has added conviction. A GDP forecast hike was expected but the unexpected part was the hike all the way to 7 percent and the accompanying robust commentary. Central bankers are conservative and circumspect on forecasts and like to err on the side of caution. The RBI is no different, until now. Governor Shaktikanta Das’s optimism has been palpable only to be matched by his deputy. In a post policy press meet, deputy governor Michael Patra said that 7 percent could be considered conservative because recent high frequency economic data for October and November suggest growth perhaps getting to above 7 percent. Sure, Patra’s comments alluded to statistical adjustments with the updated GDP data which adds credence to the forecast than a mere judgmental call would.Even so, this growth comfort only makes the probability of a policy pivot or even a rate cut remote. The optimism is clearly a double-edged sword as our piece here states. Expectations of these are being scaled back among investors now.Das has matched his growth optimism with an equal hawkishness on inflation. Keeping the repo rate on hold for the fifth consecutive time today, Das reiterated the commitment to bring retail inflation down to 4 percent, on a durable basis. “Moving forward inflation management cannot be on autopilot,” Das told reporters. “MPC will be highly alert on any signs of derailing of ongoing disinflation process.”

 Scaling to the CEO office is as tough as ever for women and executives from historically underrepresented ethnic and racial backgrounds. (Source: Getty Images) For decades, the pinnacle of corporate America has been a notorious boys’ club. If you need proof, just note that, until recently, at any given time through history more male chief executive officers named John were running big companies than the total number of women holding down the same job.There are signs that the door is starting to crack open, however.

But the big headline number, which on the surface suggests progress, also risks becoming a distraction from some troubling trends hidden within the data.To get to nearly half the C-suite, executives who are women or are Black, indigenous or other people of colour have in large part capitalised on the creation of what’s considered “new” C-suite jobs. Spencer Stuart found that taken together, these two groups make up 89 percent of all chief inclusion and diversity officers and 64 percent of all chief sustainability officers — titles that after a rapid rise now exist at more than half of Fortune 500 companies.These roles have provided a way into the C-suite for those who have long been excluded, but what they haven’t provided is a pathway to the top. While overseeing a company’s climate initiatives and diversity efforts is critically important in today’s world, corporate boards don’t view them as important enough to be a steppingstone to the CEO job. And that’s a title where progress has been woefully slow. Just 10 percent of Fortune 500 CEOs are women, while 12 percent are people from historically underrepresented ethnic and racial groups.

From this December (2023), Beijing had added Italy to the list of five countries whose citizens did not need a visa to visit China.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdThough Italy says it will continue to maintain good and cooperative ties with China, its decision has brought back the focus on the viability of the BRI viability among some of the developed and big economies in the world.India, the fifth largest economy in the world, is not part of the BRI, nor is the.Many other countries like Japan, Australia, Philippines, Vietnam, etc., though members of the BRI, have become reluctant participants because of aggressive Chinese policy in the Indo-Pacific region. Similarly, many European countries are also having second thoughts about their participation in the BRI, in order to balance their ties with the US.Italy’s objectionThe withdrawal of Italy from the BRI has not been officially confirmed by Italy or China.But media reports quoting government sources said that Italy formally submitted its plan to withdraw from the BRI a few days back.The BRI partners are obliged to give a three-month notice for withdrawal. Otherwise, their membership gets automatically renewed for another five years. Italy’s renewal was due in March next year.The decision is not a surprise as Italy has aired its dissatisfaction with the BRI in the past.Story continues below AdvertisementEven before Giorgia Meloni, Italy’s right-wing leader, became the first woman Prime Minister of the country, she had wanted to discontinue Italy’s participation in the BRI.In 2019, while still in the Opposition, Meloni had said that it was a "serious mistake" on Italy’s part to join the BRI.Italy’s growing trade gap with China could be a major reason for the dissatisfaction.According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in the period from 2019 to 2022, Italy’s exports to China increased by 19 percent to $17.3 billion.But its imports from China increased by over 70 percent, to $60 billion, in the same period.BRI has had problems in recent yearsA number of countries have had problems with BRI, as they struggled to repay loans to China, incurred for infrastructure projects under the BRI.China changed its approach to future loans under BRI because of the slowdown in the Chinese economy, that was compounded by a real estate crisis at home, and the inability of many countries to repay loans.This was reflected at the 10th BRI anniversary summit in Beijing in October this year. Though 150 countries and 30 international organisations participated, the number of foreign heads of state came down from 37 in the previous summit, to 23.China also shifted focus from large-scale investments and government involvement, to promoting “small and beautiful” projects with more private capital.The Italian decision before the crucial summit with the EU will force China to play down the development in order to maintain its attractiveness as an economic partner.India’s opposition to BRIThe reason for India’s opposition to the BRI is because its flagship project — the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) — runs through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. India’s participation in the BRI could be seen as an endorsement of Pakistan’s illegal possession of its land.India also sees the BRI as China’s attempt to expand its global influence. By roping in south Asian countries in the BRI, China has already challenged India’s primacy in the region.Not much expected at the China-EU summitExperts cautioned against high expectations from the China-EU summit. Some said it could be little more than a forum for photo-ops and exchanging talking points."If it does prove to be as empty as anticipated, it should make the EU rethink its approach to these meetings,” said one expert.After a year of intense engagement, both the EU and China are keen to hold this summit.

 Despite the promising intent behind the labour codes, their potential remains unrealised. In the year 2020, India took a bold step in simplifying its complex labour laws by consolidating 44 statutes into four comprehensive labour codes. The move was hailed as a game-changer, promising to streamline regulations, foster ease of doing business, and pave the way for formal job creation. However, despite this monumental reform, the anticipated benefits are yet to materialise due to the delay in making the rules implementable. This delay not only hampers formal job creation but also obstructs equitable improvement in per capita income, economic growth, and expansion.The four labour codes – Code on Wages, Industrial Relations Code, Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, and Code on Social Security – were envisioned as a catalyst for transformative change. They aimed to simplify compliance, enhance flexibility, and promote a conducive environment for businesses to thrive. The Code on Wages was designed to rationalise and simplify wage structures, bringing transparency and consistency. The Industrial Relations Code sought to streamline the complex web of industrial relations, making it easier for employers and employees to engage in a productive dialogue. The Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code aimed at ensuring the well-being of workers, and the Code on Social Security aimed at expanding the social security net.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdDespite the promising intent behind the labour codes, their potential remains unrealised due to the delay in formulating and notifying the rules necessary for their implementation. This bottleneck has severe repercussions for the Indian economy.Impact on Formal Job Creation: The delay in implementing the labour codes directly hampers formal job creation. Businesses, uncertain about the regulatory landscape, are hesitant to expand their workforce. The ambiguity surrounding compliance and regulations creates an environment of caution rather than confidence, thwarting the much-needed boost to employment. Drawing reference from various insights and studies conducted internationally as well as within India it is a foregone conclusion that timely implementation of labour reforms is crucial for creating a conducive environment for formal job creation.Equitable Improvement in Per Capita Income and Overall Wages: Formal job creation is not just about quantity; it's also about quality. The labour codes were envisioned to create a balance between the interests of employers and employees, fostering an environment where both can thrive. The delay in implementation perpetuates an uneven playing field, hindering the equitable improvement of per capita income. Labour reforms are the precursor to ensure equitable distribution of wealth and overall improvement of the wages and per capita income as has been the case in China.

 All taxes are not equal, and it’s important how a tax works. The US Supreme Court heard arguments on Tuesday over a dispute over a $14,279 tax bill — and the slightly more consequential question of what counts as income under the federal tax code, a definition the Biden administration would like to expand.The tax bill at the center of the case belongs to Charles and Kathleen Moore, from an investment they made in India almost two decades ago. Although they have never realised any gains, their investment has done well, and changes to tax law passed in 2017 required them to pay taxes on its increased value. The Moores argue that they have not received any income from their investment and therefore should not be subject to any tax.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdWhether the Moores’ return is income or an unrealised gain is a difficult legal question. But to an economist the argument is simple: Wealth taxes, which are part of President Joe Biden’s 2024 budget proposal, are terrible policy. Taxes are a fact of life, everyone must pay them, the wealthy more than the less wealthy. But not all taxes are equal, and it’s important how a tax works. Some taxes are harder to implement than others, and some create greater economic distortions. Based on both of these criteria, taxing wealth — including unrealised gains — is the worst way to tax.Taxing the wealth of centimillionaires, as Biden proposes, may sound harmless; these are after all very rich people (though not billionaires). But implementing this tax would be very difficult. Very rich people often get that way by starting businesses, and they have a lot of their wealth tied up in their companies. Often these companies are privately owned, and therefore very difficult to value objectively.Even for publicly traded assets, the implementation of the tax would not be straightforward. On what day is the tax liability assessed? What if the value of the asset goes down between then and the day the tax is due? Will the government owe the centimillionaires money in the year their assets lose value? The US currently taxes capital gains, where these questions don’t come up or have a clear answer.

 Next policy move expected to be a rate cut in CY24 The meeting of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) began on December 6 to review the country’s monetary policy. The MPC’s decision will be announced on December 8. The MPC is expected to maintain a status quo on both the key rates and its stance when it shares the outcome of the meeting. The benchmark policy repo rate is currently 6.50 percent with stance of “withdrawal of accommodation”. The MPC kept the policy rates on hold for the fourth consecutive time in its last monetary policy meeting.In latest released numbers, India’s GDP growth surprised positively at 7.6 percent YoY Q2FY24, beating the RBI’s projection by 110 bps for the quarter. It was backed by strong growth in manufacturing sector in Q2, making India the fastest growing large economy in the world. Also, since the last MPC meeting, consumer price index (CPI) inflation has eased to four-month low of 4.87 percent in October 2023 from 5.02 percent in September 2023 on the back of favourable base effect, vegetable price correction and the recent reduction in liquified petroleum gas (LPG) or cooking gas prices.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdThough the CPI inflation stayed within the RBI’s tolerance range of 2-6 percent for the second consecutive month, it was above the RBI projection of 4 percent."We are not out of the woods yet and have miles to go, but readings of around 5 percent and 4.9 percent in September and October, respectively, are a welcome relief from the average of 6.7 percent in 2022-23 and 7.1 percent in July-August 2023,” a November 2023 RBI bulletin said.The next two inflation readings (November and December 2023) could be close to 6 percent driven by higher food inflation, lower area sown under pulses, dip in reservoir levels, El Niño conditions and volatile global energy prices. Amongst all this, easing core inflation is a silver lining.

The news published on the date December 06, 2023 02:59 PM IST with headline  RBI likely to opt for a prolonged pause until middle of next year is: 
 The focus of the monetary policy has remained on keeping the liquidity conditions tight, after a pause in April 2023. The need to keep liquidity conditions tight is driven by the upside risk to inflation from successive food price shocks. Adverse weather events have resulted in more than 50 percent of the CPI food basket (by weight) seeing 6 percent+ inflation. The share is likely to rise to more than 60 percent in November due to rise in vegetable prices led by onions.The RBI has rightly decided to look through the food price shocks as core inflation remains well behaved and inflation expectation contained. However, recurrent food price shocks raises the risk of generalisation of price pressures (spreading from food to non-food). To prevent this RBI has kept liquidity conditions tight via Incremental cash reserve ratio (I-CRR) over August to October first week. As a result, weighted average call rates have remained closer to marginal standing facility (MSF) rate.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdIn the October policy, the RBI had surprised the market by indicating the possibility of open market operations (OMO) sales (through auction) as a tool to tighten liquidity. Since then, liquidity conditions have tightened, without the need for OMO sales. This was led by rise in currency leakage in November with the onset of the festival season and the RBI’s forex (FX) intervention. The window for OMO sales (through auction) remains limited in the near-term with liquidity conditions expected to tighten.Also read: Samir Arora's hot picks: HDFC Bank, Zomato, KPIT Tech, MCX and what more?Currency leakage tends to rise in the second half of the financial year, seasonally. Further drain on liquidity has risen from the RBI’s FX operations as balance of payments has turned negative since Q2FY24 from a substantial surplus in Q1. In Q3FY24, balance of payments has remained mildly negative with trade deficit remaining elevated and sharp slowdown in FDI inflows.

The news published on the date December 06, 2023 03:09 PM IST with headline  Why India needs to relax curbs on sugar export is: 
 The supporters of the export curbs contend that they are aimed at reining in food inflation given that sugar production is likely to fall. One type of inflation the Indian government should not worry about at all is of sugar prices. Making sugar artificially cheap — by controlling its prices through export bans and monthly sales quotas — over-incentivises its use by manufacturers of popular breakfast cereals, soft drinks and juices, and sweets. That leads to unintended health consequences, the cost of which is not being factored in by India’s policymakers.The government decided to extend restrictions on sugar exports beyond October 31 without specifying an end date. The supporters of the export curbs contend that they are aimed at reining in food inflation given that sugar production is likely to fall by 8 percent in the current crushing season. Besides, these curbs will also ensure a steady supply of feedstock to cane-based distilleries for the production of ethanol. It is argued that allowing sugar exports will reduce domestic availability and worsen food inflation. However, the weight of sugar in food and beverage price inflation is less than 3 percent, and in retail (CPI) inflation, it’s just 1.36 percent. Clearly, high sugar prices can’t be responsible for food inflation.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdThe major culprit for food inflation is high cereal prices (CPI weight 9.67 percent) and sharp seasonal fluctuations in supplies of perishable horticultural products i.e., vegetables and fruits (combined CPI weights 9.93 percent). High cereal prices can be largely attributed to frequent hikesin minimum support prices, which are intended to boost farmers’ income, amidst shamefully low farm productivity. Yet such market-distorting policies continue. Also, a serious lack of post-harvest infrastructure such as cold chains has been making it difficult to manage the impact of seasonalvariations in supplies of perishables on food inflation. Controlling sugar supplies (by banning exports or imposing monthly sales quotas) won’t be enough to rein in food inflation.Steadily increasing cane output — because of the continuation of cane price populism — requires steadily rising cane crushing capacities. Preventing sugar mills from making profitable overseas sales will discourage them from ramping up capex. That will hamper future supply responses and make price management even more difficult.Signalling Shortages
 
The news published on the date December 06, 2023 01:45 PM IST with headline  Putin’s shadow sanctions-busters are a test of Western resolve is: 
 Imposing a price cap on Russian oil was never going to bring about Putin’s defeat, but it remains a valuable tool for containing his ambition. For the past year, the US and its Group of Seven allies have imposed a cap on the price of Russian oil exports, banning traders that use Western services from selling Russian crude above $60 a barrel. The idea was to limit President Vladimir Putin’s ability to finance his war in Ukraine without causing a spike in global energy markets.At least initially, the policy worked as intended, depriving the Kremlin of tens of billions of dollars in revenue. But as a Bloomberg News investigation and accompanying documentary reveal, Russia has devised an increasingly effective system to circumvent sanctions and continue selling oil to the developing world at prices above the $60-per-barrel cap. Maintaining pressure on Putin will require Western governments to adopt a tougher approach.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdMonthly Russian income from oil exports has doubled since April, to more than $11 billion, with revenue in October at its highest since May 2022. Instead of using Western tankers and insurers that would be subject to the price cap, Russia has largely turned to a “shadow fleet” of aging and unregulated vessels to transport its supply, operated by intermediaries in the Middle East and Asia. More than 70 percent of Russia’s oil is being moved by shadow carriers, compared to less than 30 percent before the war. An array of small and mostly anonymous shipping companies, traders and middlemen have reaped much of the $11 billion in profits generated from helping Russia evade the price cap, according to Bloomberg’s estimate.The rise of this underground market poses challenges for Ukraine and the West. It has allowed Russia to sell its oil at a premium above the cap, replenishing the Kremlin’s war chest. Regardless of how long the conflict in Ukraine lasts, the emergence of so many murky new industry players threatens to make the oil trade less predictable and harder to regulate. That’s particularly worrisome because of the heightened risk of accidents involving old and uninsured tankers, which could cause significant environmental damage and impose enormous cleanup costs on Western governments.What can be done?
 
The news published on the date December 06, 2023 01:48 PM IST with headline  Bitcoin hype will clash with the Rolex recession is: 
 It seems a little cavalier to start drumming up enthusiasm for Bitcoin if we enter an environment where real cash, not the virtual kind, is king. “BUY BTC” The logo stamped on this week’s leaked version of the Grand Theft Auto VI trailer, depicting a faux glamorous world of speedboats, supercars and “shoot-em-ups,” was well timed. Bitcoin’s price has almost tripled this year to around $42,000, where it was before the 2022 Terra debacle. Frothy six- to seven-figure price targets are back. With Coinbase Global Inc’s boss touting Bitcoin as “key” to the West’s future and El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele demanding his critics apologize, you’d think an actual use case had been found.Except — it hasn’t. And at the risk of sounding like the Simpsons’ “Old Man Yells At Cloud,” there are plenty of reasons to be cautious about this umpteenth upward swing on the crypto rollercoaster ride at a time of economic slowdown and possible recession.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdThe bull case preached by the laser-eyed and Luna-tattooed crowd is, as before, driven by sentiment and speculation rather than utility. Bitcoin may be a glorified pet rock in terms of money-ness, but people like to hoard it and trade it as a risky hybrid of gold and NASDAQ startup in the hope of outsized gains. The optimistic view is that any news will be good news as bad actors like Sam Bankman-Fried or Changpeng Zhao get flushed out, mass-market spot ETFs get closer, and potential interest-rate cuts lift risk appetite. With a rising price providing a positive feedback loop, who wouldn’t want to take a punt?Yet looking back at Bitcoin’s history, what seems to have really propelled its price to records in recent years has been unprecedented monetary easing by central banks and an increase in money supply to new highs, neither of which look likely to happen again soon. A paper by S&P analysts published in May found a positive correlation of 0.75 — not quite causation, but suggesting more than coincidence — between money supply growth and crypto assets since 2017, with virtual money “performing well” in times of expansionary monetary policy. As a hedge against economic shocks, the record was less clear — let’s not forget Bitcoin fell 50% when Covid-19 first hit in March 2020 — and as a hedge against inflation, the results were inconclusive and not as good as gold.And if easy money is Bitcoin’s secret sauce, there doesn’t seem to be much of it around. The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet peaked at nearly $9 trillion last year and has since fallen to around $7.8 trillion. Fears that still-high borrowing costs will coincide with a recession have squished demand for many other speculative assets that boomed during the pandemic, from NFTs to second-hand luxury watches. Hence the “Rolex recession” concept: The average price of a second-hand Rolex has been sliding since 2022. Over the past month, this corollary of the crypto-wealthy’s financial health is down almost 10 percent year-on-year. It seems a little cavalier to start drumming up enthusiasm for Bitcoin if we enter an environment where real cash, not the virtual kind, is king.

At one point, it had chugged along so long that one New York Times reporter included it in a list of “zombie biotechs,” companies churning through cash for decades without ever turning a profit. While a drug developed by one of its partners that used its technology was approved in 2013, ImmunoGen didn’t have its own product — Elahere, for advanced ovarian cancer — on the market until last year.

 Alternative funds will continue to be the fastest-growing segment of India’s investment landscape. There are plenty of high-performing private investment vehicles in India, but it’s the few that are being set up for dubious purposes that may bring harsher regulatory scrutiny to the country’s most rapidly expanding asset class.So far, the most egregious use of these so-called alternative investment funds has been by nonbank finance companies, several of whom have employed these bespoke structures for pure regulatory arbitrage.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdWhen it looked like their big-ticket borrowers, especially real-estate projects, were going to default, some financiers took recourse to new funds tailormade for them by Wall Street firms. Investors who pooled money were issued senior securities, earning them interest. The finance company also contributed, but in a smaller junior tranche that ranks lower down in the repayment pecking order and is the first to absorb any losses.The private funds then lent money to the same stressed borrowers who, in turn, repaid their original loans and avoided bankruptcy proceedings. Finance companies were happy, too, since any mark-to-market losses on the securities they now held would be far lower than the provisioning burden they would have had to bear in case of soured credit.This is how at least some shadow lenders in India have “evergreened” their loan books to avoid being on the radar of the Reserve Bank of India, their regulator. But the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the stock-market watchdog, has cottoned on to the sleight of hand. According to a Reuters report in October, the SEBI has detected at least a dozen cases involving $1.8 billion to $2.4 billion where alternative investment funds have been misused to sidestep other financial regulators including the RBI.

 The Federal Reserve and others will be testing a great uncertainty: Just how much in central bank funds do banks need to feel comfortable? Big central banks are going to keep shrinking their balance sheets next year, pulling money out of the financial system, even if the fight against inflation looks to be won and interest rate cuts begin. Their aim is to restore the role of markets in supplying and setting the price of money.It’ll be a bumpy ride. The Federal Reserve and others will be testing a great uncertainty: Just how much in central bank funds do banks need to feel comfortable? The last time the Fed got near this threshold in September 2019, short-term interest rates in money markets went haywire, spiking higher and leaving some hedge funds scrambling for cash.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdWonkish as this sounds, it’s far from a niche interest. Rising rates and declining reserves – the special money used only by banks, central banks and the government – have already helped spark a regional bank crisis and the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.US banks are competing fiercely for deposits, a key source of reserves, which some see as troubling. For Mark Cabana, rates strategist at Bank of America Securities, it suggests the Fed will have to stop shrinking its books sooner than it intends. However, the Fed and Bank of England have created new ways to support money markets, giving them greater confidence in testing where the threshold for reserves lies. This could turn into a monetary game of chicken in the next few months.To grasp the mechanics at work, here’s a quick recap on reserves: This special money is created mostly by government spending, or central banks buying assets like Treasuries or lending against them. Before the 2008 financial crisis, banks in the US, UK and elsewhere mainly got reserves by borrowing them from private sources, like each other. Central banks would just top up any small deficits that appeared in the system. Since then, however, quantitative easing and the flood of cash to get economies through the Covid-19 pandemic left banking systems with a vast excess.
 
The news published on the date December 05, 2023 04:57 PM IST with headline  Private credit titans win the incentive fee lottery is: 
 invest The $1.6 trillion private credit market is enjoying a “golden moment,” in the words of one Blackstone Inc executive, as banks retreat from risky lending and investors flock to funds offering double-digit returns on corporate loans. But those jumping on the bandwagon shouldn’t forget private credit fees are very lucrative too. As this asset class goes mainstream and mints billionaires, investors — aka limited partners — should insist on lower costs, and oppose incentives that can reward managers for little effort.From a fee perspective, private credit is a sweet gig. There’s a 1 percent to 2 percent asset-management fee, plus a further take of around 15 percent of profit once a specified return threshold is exceeded, typically around 6 percent. Once that triggers, a “catchup” ensures the managers receive their share of the entire profit, not just the income in excess of the hurdle.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdA 6 percent hurdle might have made sense when interest rates were near zero, but it represents little challenge now that US and UK benchmark rates are above 5 percent. Private credit loans have floating interest rates, so borrowers are often paying 10 percent once a spread is included. In other words, managers can’t really fail to get their performance bonus, providing defaults don’t spoil the party.“If you have a credit fund that is now enjoying 500 basis points of excess return because the base rate has gone up, that basically all flows into that accrued incentive fee bucket,” Michael Arougheti, co-founder of private credit giant Ares Management Corp told investors in September. Fixed hurdle rates are “well-entrenched market conventions” and “nobody” is trying to impugn their value, he added.Of course, the fact that private credit funds are easily meeting performance hurdles implies clients are doing well too. But I’m not alone in wondering wonder why this financially sophisticated industry doesn’t use flexible incentive hurdles instead, to prevent fund managers automatically winning the lottery just because interest rates increase.
 
The news published on the date December 05, 2023 04:44 PM IST with headline  What makes the RBI concerned about algo model-based lending is: 
 A lack of transparency raises valid concerns about accountability and fairness in lending practices. Resonating with a cautionary tone, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das recently articulated concerns over algorithmic model-based lending. This reiterates the regulatory commitment to maintaining the stability and resilience of the financial sector in the face of evolving fintech dynamics. Algorithmic models, powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning, often operate as ‘black boxes’, making it challenging to decipher the rationale behind their decisions. This lack of transparency raises valid concerns about accountability and fairness in lending practices. Many lending models are built using algorithms. The fear is that these algorithms, if not rigorously monitored, and if not traceable to root cause, could inadvertently perpetuate biases or discriminate against certain variables and also lead to bad credit decisions.In response to potential risks, the banking regulator recently raised the risk weights for consumer credit exposure by 25 percentage points to 125 percent. This reflects concerns about the possibility of undue risk accumulation in the system arising from information gaps in these models, potentially resulting in a dilution of underwriting standards. The RBI has been kind and patient in asking the boards of its regulated entities to be vigilant, and to take accountability about lending models and lending exposure across segments. To be fair to the RBI, these are essential roles of the individual boards to ensure prudential and risk-managed behaviour in their enterprises.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdUpdating Algorithms DynamicallyTo be fair to those financial institutions that are risk-prudent, they revamp their credit models every 12-18 months and update their algorithms dynamically. Regulators should make this a rule, instead of worrying about the use of algorithmic models. In reality, algorithm-based lending has not only reduced operational costs but has also expanded the outreach of financial services providers. The collaboration between banks, NBFCs and fintechs has increased, leading to the introduction of innovative products, services and business models.However, the apprehensions surrounding algorithmic lending must be contextualised within the broader landscape of financial innovation. The increasing reliance on newer datasets including unstructured data, and digital technologies is an inexorable shift, driven by the need for efficiency, speed and adaptability in financial services. Algorithms, when designed and monitored judiciously, have the potential to enhance credit assessment, reduce processing times and democratise access to financial products.

 Should people blow up small fortunes on lavish weddings be asked to spend the money locally or to spend less on weddings? Recently, Prime Minister Modi urged Indians to hold their lavish destination weddings in India, rather than abroad. This would boost domestic tourism and the domestic economy, he said. The response has been varied.Travel agencies are miffed, wondering aloud how flights to foreign destinations would be viable if they only carried inbound tourists, while Indians travelled only on domestic routes. Wedding planners and event managers — those of them who have developed a practice in fancy foreign locales — are resentful, too. Staunch believers in the individual’s inalienable right to pursue happiness as they deem fit bridle at this apparent attempt at state control of something as intimate as their nuptials.

They could, perhaps, consider if the economy would gain more from bank credit going to finance consumption expenditure or from bank credit going to finance investment.Social reformers around the world, particularly in India, have urged people to shun conspicuous consumption and use their riches to meet more worthy goals. Such advice contains both a moral injunction against flaunting one’s wealth and the practical consideration of accumulating capital, implicitly articulating the definition of capital as money used to generate more money. Of particular note has been the protestant ethic, of conserving capital and using it to produce yet more wealth, as a religious calling and duty to God.

US maritime shipping is hampered by the infamous Jones Act, which prevents foreign-flagged vessels from moving goods between US ports. For most kinds of cargo, this is not a huge deal, but it’s a huge obstacle when it comes to the politically sensitive issues of getting oil to refineries and gasoline to consumers. Right now, gasoline components are often shipped from the Gulf Coast for blending in the Bahamas, then reshipped to the Northeast in order to avoid the high costs of using Jones-compliant vessels. The Jones Act is also creating problems for the offshore wind industry, which is struggling with high component costs.In theory, eliminating the Jones Act could have even larger implications for the supply chain, by turning maritime shipping into a meaningful competitor to rail and trucks for moving all kinds of goods. In practice, that’s unlikely due to limited capacity at the ports.

Douglas MacArthur. Like the best entries in the series, it humanizes the disaster through its cast, led by Ryunosuke Kamiki, who plays a kamikaze pilot plagued with guilt after fleeing his duty. Set in 1947, the aftermath of the war is front and center, straddling a line frequently seen in Japanese cinema of deploring the needless sacrifice of human lives, while simultaneously having pride in the Japanese war industry’s ingenuity and engineering.Indeed, the war has always been core to Godzilla. The monster himselfhas been seen to represent the US, the academic Chon Noriega argued in a seminal 1987 paper. He might be the physical manifestation of the “sleeping giant” that Japanese admiral Isoroku Yamamoto was supposed to have warned of waking in the US, prior to the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.
 
The news published on the date December 04, 2023 07:44 PM IST with headline  Private credit isn’t as risky as some may believe is: 
 As ever in finance, some are exploring innovations that could undermine these good characteristics. The rapid rise of funds that make loans directly to buyout deals and other highly indebted companies — known as private credit — is among the hottest topics in finance. The sector has minted fresh billionaires, while being called a bubble by traditional financiers like UBS Group AG Chairman Colm Kelleher and attracting warnings about the dangers it could pose.Investors need to be sharp-eyed about what private credit managers are doing with their money. This is, after all, high-yield, high-risk debt. The mad scramble for new business could easily lead to many bad lending decisions, as it always has in the history of banking. But fears that private credit could threaten the financial system should be more soberly assessed. The structure of most private credit funds answers many of the questions about panics and runs posed by the 2008 meltdown because they typically fund their lending with long-term liabilities that can’t easily take flight.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdInterest in private credit managers has ballooned as the money has flooded in, while their lending approach brought advantages over traditional buyout funding, particularly this year. Total assets under management in the sector have nearly doubled since 2019 to more than $1.6 trillion, according to Preqin Pro, a data provider. Scale has led to ever-larger individual loans, like this month’s record $4.9 billion for online classifieds companyAdevinta ASA.This year, private equity deal makers have struggled to raise debt through leveraged loans arranged by banks or junk bonds, opening more doors for private credit fund managers. Bond investors lost appetite for high-yield debt, while big banks have demanded extra pricing flexibility when underwriting buyout loans to protect against getting stuck with unsellable debt, like the $13 billion that helped fund Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter, now named X, last year.By contrast, private credit managers have been able to offer more certainty to private equity firms trying to finance takeovers because they set the price themselves and keep the loans rather than trying to sell them later.

Dear Reader,Will the BJP stay in power or not at the Centre is a question that investors toss around in their minds sometimes, it appears. If they don’t, brokerage houses helpfully put out reports predicting how much the stock market can fall by if the BJP loses power in the 2024 general elections.

One of them is, he writes, “Women voters have been crucial to the BJP’s poll advances since 2014 in north India, on the back of welfare schemes and last-mile delivery with direct-benefit-transfers. Their rise has been a game-changer overturning traditional politics… This trend is here to stay. As these elections showed, no major party can afford to ignore this.”Our columnist GC Shekhar has also written on the impact of these elections on the national elections, “The impact of these results, ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha, should be gauged against the 2019 LS results when the BJP had won all but four Lok Sabha seats out of the 65 seats from these three states after having lost the Assembly elections in 2018. With such an emphatic win in these Assembly elections, the party will be more than confident to repeat or even improve upon the 2019 show in the heartland.”The stock markets were ecstatic at the outcome and our in-house markets expert, Shishir Asthana got it right in his analysis of the outcome. He wrote that exit polls had not predicted this outcome and that meant a rally could be in the works, aided by global developments and also an insight into how derivative market positions could add curry to the rally.

 Although all sectors have contributed to the growth of GDP this quarter, the largest share of growth in value addition was from manufacturing. Data released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation show India's GDP at constant prices, grew at the rate of 7.6 percent annually, during the second quarter of the year 2023-24, faster than the 6.2 percent growth recorded for the second quarter of 2022-23. India's GDP at current prices in the second quarter was Rs 71.66 lakh crore, and that raised India's per capita annual income to Rs 2.01 lakh during the quarter or $2,436 ($1=Rs 82.5, average September market price). In the first half of fiscal year 2023-24, the economy expanded by 7.7 percent. If this pace of GDP growth continues, then India's per capita income may reach $3,600 by September 2030. The per capita income was hardly $1,560 in the year 2014.Although all sectors have contributed to the growth of GDP this quarter, the largest share of growth in value addition was from manufacturing, which grew by 13.9 percent. The second biggest growth sector was construction, which grew by 13.3 percent. The third sector was electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services, where 10.1 percent growth was recorded. Mining contributed with 10 percent growth. The growth in the service sector was not very remarkable. A matter of concern in this quarter was the performance of the agriculture sector which recorded a low 1.2 percent growth. But this is not due to any fundamental flaw but due to uncertain and insufficient monsoons.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdImpact of Atmanirbhar Bharat PolicyGrowth in manufacturing indicates the success of the Union government's Atmanirbhar Bharat policy. A large number of new production units are coming up in every sector. These include various types of products including electronics, telecom, machinery, solar equipment, defence equipment, chemicals, toys, textiles and so on. Due to the production-linked incentive (PLI) policy, the production of laptops and semiconductors may also start soon.If we look at some specific indicators, a significant growth rate was visible in coal, steel, cement, mining and power generation. Coal production registered an increase of 16.3 percent, while cement output grew by 10.2 percent. Steel production grew 19.5 percent. The 11.5 percent growth in mining is also remarkable. The number of airline passengers increased by 22.7 percent and railway passenger figures are also showing growth. Deposits in banks grew by 11.5 percent, while loans given by banks rose at a faster rate of 13 percent. All these figures point towards an improving economic environment in the country. It has to be understood that the growth of manufacturing has a direct impact on employment. It’s beyond doubt that employment opportunities in manufacturing are much greater than in the service sector.

The news published on the date December 04, 2023 11:27 AM IST with headline  Q2 GDP: Agriculture, jobs growth cause for concern is: 
 Data on government spending are usually based on budgetary expenditure. The second quarter GDP growth of 7.6 percent can be viewed as a strong statement of “resilient domestic economic activity in the strange and heady environment of formidable global headwinds” as the RBI describes current conditions. Evaluating interim economic performance is always difficult because of the base effects (as past numbers change a lot) and also the fact that some of the numbers (e.g., some in agriculture, services, utilities) are based on ratio and proportions of annual projections rather than actual field data. According to the World Bank, final figures tended to be different from previous numbers, on average, by 0.5 percentage points. All of this is well known, nevertheless, measuring the economy’s performance is crucial for policymakers. The most common assessment of the current quarter's performance has been that it well and truly exceeded street estimates of 6.5 percent. It is interesting to understand how this happened.Manufacturing ReboundsStory continues below AdvertisementRemove AdFrom the output side, manufacturing contributed 33 percent of the incremental Q2 growth, growing by 13.9 percent. It upstaged even the services sector, the contribution of which fell to 46 percent. While the low base helped manufacturing (there was negative 3.8 percent growth in Q2 2023), the IIP and core infrastructure sector data did show increased production in cement, steel and coal. The construction sector grew by 13.3 percent aided by both residential and infrastructure investment, especially by the government. Agriculture was a huge worry, as its low growth (1.8 percent) has consequences for rural jobs and incomes. However, the sluggish growth in the services sector was puzzling, especially in the context of booming goods and services tax (GST) collections. The explanation according to some that information technology (IT) and software firms were under stress doesn’t sound convincing as IT and software services form only about 10 percent of the total service sector GVA. Bank credit data also seem out of sync with output data. Even accounting for lags, between September 2022 and September 2023, industry received less than 10 percent of the incremental credit, with 46 percent going to personal loans and 33 percent to services sectors.The expenditure side also had a few surprises. The contribution of personal consumption to incremental Q2 growth fell to 24 percent, as it grew by a measly 3.1 percent (compared to 6 percent during Q1 and 8.3 percent in Q2 of the previous year). This was a shocker, especially since the high-frequency indicators such as growth in automobile sales, FMCG and airline tickets seemed to suggest a consumption surge. The other surprise was the 49 percent contribution to incremental Q2 growth from gross fixed capital formation (or private investment). It is believed to be led by higher private capex investment though it is more likely that household (through housing) investment also had gone up. Bank credit at least, points to this. Data on government spending are usually based on budgetary expenditure and the growth of 12.4 percent in Q2 is attributed to the government spending nearly 49 percent of its full-year budget on capex, along with increased spending by 25 state governments. But government spending came in only third after private investment and personal consumption. There were no surprises on the external trade deficit which grew sharply by 95 percent during Q2 due to a continuous decline in exports. The increased trade deficit knocked off about 46 percent from the incremental growth in Q2.Growth In The First Half

Policy makers in New Delhi have been hoping to entice Tesla Inc. to produce electric vehicles in India. Musk, meanwhile, wants to sell his cars here without paying the exorbitant import tariffs that India charges.According to Bloomberg News, the two sides may now be close to an agreement that would slash tariffs on Tesla imports from 2024, as long as the company sets up a factory in India within the next two years. Tesla may invest $2 billion in the plant and commit to buying as much as $15 billion worth of inputs from domestic automotive component producers.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdMusk could certainly count such a deal as a win.

According to the study, this blending initiative gels well with the government's macro-level move to make India a gas-based economy, with a target to increase the current share of gas in the energy mix from 6 per cent currently to 15 per cent by 2030.The IBA estimates show that 5 per cent blending of biogas with natural gas can reduce LNG imports worth USD 1.17 billion. This can also bring down per capita CO2 emissions by two per cent, benchmarked to the 2019 figure, which was 1.9 metric tonne of CO2 per person in India. Additionally, the body says preventing organic waste going to landfills can bring innumerable benefits.The CBO scheme shall encourage investment of around Rs 37,500 crore and facilitate the establishment of at least 750 compressed bio gas (CBG) projects by 202829, as per government estimates. This is going to improve India's energy security, as it is currently heavily reliant on imported natural gas to meet its energy needs.

The news published on the date December 01, 2023 11:14 AM IST with headline  Robust macros, bullish market drive FPIs to park Rs 8,147 cr in Indian equities on Nov 30 is: 
 FII's remained buyers in the local equity markets for the fourth straight session with buying around $1.2 billion With an infusion of Rs 8,147.85 crore on November 30 alone, foreign investors continued to be net buyers of Indian equities for the fifth straight session, showed provisional data from the National Stock Exchange. The foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought stocks worth around $1.2 billion in the last four sessions, the NSDL data showed.Analysts believe the significant buying on November 30 was triggered by several factors, including a $1-billion inflow from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) during MSCI rebalancing. Additionally, foreign investors stepped up their long-term positions based on India's robust macroeconomic fundamentals. Optimism surged further on positive exit polls and the second-quarter GDP number.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdTraders noted increased interest from FIIs in Tata Technologies, which made a bumper listing on the day of monthly expiry, as some didn't receive IPO allotments. Few traders noted some FIIs building positions in defence stocks after the Defence Acquisition Council's approval of procurement for the Air Force and the Army, including light combat helicopters (LCH) and light combat aircraft (LCA) MK-1A.After its recent rebalancing on November 30, the MSCI Global Standard Index adjusted with the inclusion of nine Indian stocks such as IndusInd Bank, Suzlon Energy, Persistent Systems, and Paytm parent One97 Communications earlier this month. Fresh additions to the index were APL Apollo, Polycab, Macrotech Developers, Tata Motors, and Tata Communications. And, there was no exclusion. The inclusion is likely to pave way for a passive inflow of nearly $1.5 billion, according to calculations by Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research.Traders cited declining US bond yields and a weaker dollar amid reduced geopolitical tension as reasons behind the increased FII interest in Indian equities. On the policy front, whispers are getting louder that the US Federal Reserve may soon start reversing the rate hikes. The anticipation aided the overall bullish sentiment, while an upgrade on India by several brokerages have also sparked increased interest from foreign investors.
 
The news published on the date December 01, 2023 09:55 AM IST with headline  GDP upside may not sustain is: 
 The turnaround in export growth to positive territory in Q2 FY2024 played a key role in boosting GDP growth in the quarter. India’s GDP growth print for Q2 FY2024 was expected to moderate sequentially from 7.8 percent in Q1 FY2024, on account of a normalising base and a weak agricultural outcome following the sub-par monsoon. While this materialised in the initial data for that quarter, the extent of the slowdown was exceedingly mild at just 20 bps; as a result, the GDP growth printed at 7.6 percent in Q2, well above our forecast of 7 percent, which was already above consensus (6.8 percent).The stronger-than-anticipated growth turnout was largely driven by the manufacturing and the construction segments, with the two together contributing as much as 3.5 percentage points to the headline gross value added (GVA) growth print in the quarter as against just 1.5 percentage points in Q1 FY2024. These sectors benefitted from the long dry spell and the continued YoY decline in commodity prices, with the former boosting volumes and the latter reflecting in improved margins, and consequently higher GVA growth.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdSome sectors reported GVA prints in line with our forecasts, including the tepid 1.2 percent rise for agriculture and the double-digit expansion for mining and quarrying, and electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services. The sub-par, uneven monsoons expectedly boosted the expansion of the latter two segments, by providing an extended period for mining activity and leading to a higher demand for electricity from the farm sector and households. That GVA growth in these sectors would be high was imminent from the elevated volume growth in both these sectors as per the IIP data.Lastly, the three core services sub-sectors, namely trade, hotels, transport, etc., financial, real estate and professional services, and public administration, defence and other services disappointed with weaker than projected prints. To some extent, the reasons behind this could be the slowdown in services exports, continued monetary transmission and lower-than-budgeted growth of state governments’ revenue spending.Capital Formation Robust

 Equity rally challenges Federal Reserve's control as S&P 500 hits records, fueled by rate-cut expectations, raising concerns for Jerome Powell. Is the equity rally getting too hot for the Federal Reserve? It’s an increasingly pressing question for Jerome Powell, after three months of gains put pressure on his efforts to keep screws on the economy tight.Fueled by uncertain bets that the central bank will embark on a protracted series of interest-rate cuts this year, the S&P 500 set fresh records in five straight sessions before Friday, extending an upward march that has added $8 trillion to shareholder value. Gains pushed a measure of financial conditions to the loosest since early 2022.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdPolicy makers seldom say it out loud, but advances in equities — and the sense of affluence they induce across Wall Street and Main Street — have the potential to work against efforts to rein in inflation, by adding fresh fuel to the consumption and investment cycle. A study recently published on the National Bureau of Economic Research website called stocks the biggest influence on financial conditions and said swaying them is a crucial channel of monetary policy.While bulls would no doubt welcome dovish signals when the Fed meets next week, easing too soon is not without hazards. Among them: That markets boil over and the resulting economic wealth effect works against the Fed chair’s bid to squeeze out excess price pressures.“When you’re at full employment and then you watch a significant increase in stock market wealth, intuitively to me, that would be more inflationary,” said Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer at Leuthold Group. “The stock market’s rally in anticipation of Fed rate cuts has been a form of easing in and of itself. That, ironically, could reduce the odds of rate cuts in coming months.”

 Analysts foresee a 3.5% QoQ decline in EBITDA, driven by reduced EBITDA per ton in India due to higher coking coal costs. Trade Watchlist Portfolio Message Set Alert livebselivenselive Volume Todays L/H More × Tata Steel Ltd is expected to see a sequential dip in net profit for the December 2023 quarter, primarily attributed to challenges in European operations, according to analysts. The company will report its earnings on January 24.The average of estimates by seven analysts polled by Moneycontrol suggests a consolidated net profit of Rs 702.70 crore, reflecting a 16 percent decline from the previous quarter. In the December 2022 quarter, the company reported a loss of around Rs 2384 crore.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdConsolidated revenue for the quarter is pegged at Rs 56,400.50 crore, with a 1.3 percent on-quarter increase driven by higher sales realisation in Indian operations and increased sales volume in India. However, this is partially offset by lower sales volume and realisation in Europe. Year-on-year (YoY) revenue is likely to decline by 1.2 percent.Analysts foresee a 3.5 percent QoQ decline in EBITDA, driven by reduced EBITDA per tonne in India due to higher coking coal costs. Despite increased realisation and sales volume in India, this impact outweighs the gains. In Europe, weaker EBITDA per tonne is expected due to lower sales volume and realisation, partially offset by reduced coking coal costs. Additionally, analysts anticipate a sequential drop in EBITDA per tonne in Europe due to lower sales volume and operating leverage.Analysts further predict a 2 percent growth in standalone volumes for the third quarter, reaching 4.9 million tonnes. They anticipate an increase of around Rs 1,200 per tonne in realisations and expect the standalone EBITDA per tonne to rise around 10 percent to Rs 14,700. However higher costs are likely to partially offset the realisation gains. Given that Tata Steel has captive iron ore, the company would not be impacted from higher ore prices leading to margin expansion sequentially, analysts said. Corus EBITDA per tonne is expected to be negative, at $177.

 buy Trade Watchlist Portfolio Message Set Alert livebselivenselive Volume Todays L/H More × Motilal Oswal's research report on Hindustan UnileverHindustan Unilever (HUVR)'s performance was below expectations in 3QFY24. The company reported a 2% volume growth (estimate of 2%) and nearly flat revenue growth (estimate of 4%). Volume recovery is being delayed, especially in rural areas, despite price cuts and consumer promotions. The trend of urban growth outpacing rural areas, and the premium segment outperforming the mass market, has continued. The benign raw material inflation continued to drive gross margin (up 400bp YoY, down 100bp QoQ), despite partial benefits being passed on to consumers. The gross profit was up 8% YoY; however, higher A&P (up 35% YoY) offset the benefits and resulted in flat EBITDA.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdOutlookManagement is increasing brand investments to stimulate volume growth in preparation for the volume recovery phase and to counter local competition. Volume recovery is slower than expected so far, but price cuts across categories (mass segment is highly price-sensitive), benign headline inflation, and government’s initiatives should aid rural demand in 2024. HUVR is one of the best growth recovery plays. Reiterate BUY with a revised TP of INR 2,900.For all recommendations report, click here

 Buy Trade Watchlist Portfolio Message Set Alert livebselivenselive Volume Todays L/H More × Motilal Oswal's research report on Metro BrandsMetro Brands (METRO) reported weak revenue growth of 6% YoY (12% miss) as same-store sales declined 10% due to a high base last year (Covid) and a soft demand and pricing environment. A higher growth contribution of INR3000+ ASP products boosted gross margins, which resulted in adj. EBITDA margin/PAT margin of 33.6%/18% (in line). In the near term, we believe that the risk of soft demand, potential losses in Fila, and a moderation in margins could weigh on growth. But, in the long term, healthy store economics, steady store adds and a growth opportunity in Fila/Foot Locker should drive a CAGR of 22%/32% in revenue/PAT over FY24-26. We reiterate our BUY rating on the stock.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdOutlookWe have not factored in Fila and Foot Locker earnings, but we believe they have revenue potential of INR15-20b over the next 3-5 years (i.e., 30-40% share of METRO). Since both the brands are at the initial stage of investing, we value Fila/Foot Locker at a ~75% discount to the potential value, which creates an option value of INR150 (Exhibit 2), thus arriving at a valuation of INR1,380 per share.For all recommendations report, click here

He believes if any of the unsecured lending done as of today starts to unravel, fintechs and the lower-rated NBFCs will see the maximum impact. Edited excerpts. (Read part 1 here.)Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdApart from the boom in unsecured lending and personal loans, what have been the other big triggers for the banking industry in the past year? Going ahead, what will be the new triggers?I think retail and secured mortgages will continue to be the mainstay of the banking system. Now, unsecured loan growth is expected to come down over the next 12 to 18 months, because that's what the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) wants. Banks’ exposure to NBFCs will also come down. This will be offset by mortgages, which will still be decent, steady, and healthy. SME lending will also pick up, and private sector banks have been gaining market share in this segment. And we are hoping that private sector capex picks up a little bit. Right now, we are in election mode. Maybe post-elections, in the second half of FY25, some extra pick-up can happen in the capacity utilisation level, which currently stands at 80 percent. So, in our view, that's where the opportunity is.And I should emphasise that corporate lending will not pick up in a big way because the capex cycle takes time to flow through. First come the sanctions, and then disbursements happen in stages, depending on the project execution phases. So, it will not be a big immediate trigger. But it will pick up gradually over the next two years.

 Nilesh Shah, Managing Director- Kotak AMC India’s capital markets face three big challenges, namely, small amounts of money raised in IPOs, depth and breadth of debt markets, and a need for an alternative to grey markets, said Nilesh Shah, Managing Director of Kotak Mutual Fund.While comparing today’s bull market to that in 1992, he said that a primary challenge lies in the exponential growth of the Indian share market. “More investors are pursuing shares than in normal times. As of today, our capital market is deep for equity but not as deep for hybrid and debt. In fact, my concern is that with the growing popularity of equity, the remaining money in the debt market poses a challenge to deposit growth for banks,” said Shah at the AIBI Annual Convention 2023-34 event on January 19.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove Ad"Can we afford a country running on just one wheel of equity? Or do we need a multi-faceted approach with wings in equity, debt, and hybrid?" said Shah, adding, "We need to develop the mesh market and hybrid market as much as our equity market."The second challenge is the mismatch between the number of IPOs and the capital raised, said Shah. Despite the increasing number of investors, the market is regressing in terms of IPO size rather than progressing."The challenge remains in how we can transform our capital market to emphasize size, not just quantity. Although numerous IPOs are coming to raise capital, what we truly need is a deep market capable of providing capital for a large number of issues."

 As financial services sector command the highest weightage in benchmark Nifty (around 37 percent), any weakness in related-stocks could keep it subdued Strong global cues prompted domestic frontline indices - BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty 50 snap three-day losing streak on January 19 led by auto and metal stocks. Analysts, however, warn that the rally is prone to fizzle out amid the corporate earnings season. They suggested investors to keenly watch out 21,500 levels for Nifty as any breach could send markets into a tailspin.At close, Sensex was up 0.7 percent to 71,683, while NSE Nifty 50 rose 0.7 percent to 21,622 on January 19.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove Ad"It is not a very decisive pullback. Friday's recovery comes after 3 days of decline and that is quite normal," said Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice President- Technical Research at Religare Broking. He pointed out that 21,700-21,850 could be the next resistance levels for Nifty.On the other hand, Raja Venkataraman, Co-Founder at Neotrader noted that 21,500 would be a crucial level for investors to watch out. "Any breach below this level could send Nifty down to 21,800. But if it sustained above 21,500, it could rise up to 22,200," he told Moneycontrol.Typically, the month of January is usually a volatile one, explained markets experts as heavy newsflow around India Inc's December quarter performance and global rejigs keep markets volatile.

Asset quality tripped again with slippages being higher at Rs17.7bn/2.2% of loans mainly due to stress in VF (primarily attributed to recent floods in TN), agri, LAP, and merchant-acquiring business. However, the bank expects some NPA recovery in Q4 leading to moderation in NPA ratios. Separately, the bank has reported Rs2bn release from contingent buffer due to reduced exposure to Telco (Vodafone). In-line with the bank’s stated liability retailization strategy, retail deposit share has improved to 45% from 43% a year ago, which it plans to take up to ~50% over FY24-26E.

Ltd (CF) and Organic India Pvt Ltd (OI) are in line with their strategic priority to expand the total addressable market (TAM) into adjacent, high-margin, and high-growth categories. The key highlights are as follows: These acquisitions will enable TATACONS to advance in its journey to become the leading FMCG player, offering a wide range of products across pantry, liquid, mini meals, and sustainable categories. The incremental TAM in India and internationally will increase to ~INR1t with these new additions. Through these acquisitions, TATACONS can benefit from multiple synergies, including access to new markets, wider distribution reach, optimized trade margins via increased shelf space, better operating leverage through economies of scale, and higher margins. We have factored in the financials of both the companies, assuming a fundraise via a rights issue amounting to INR35b, which is 50% of the total deal value (or 61% of the immediate funding requirement of INR57.25b).

 The high price of so much scrutiny. (Source: Bloomberg) Two major events are shaking up the asset-management world. Blackstone Inc raised $1.3 billion for its first retail private equity fund, targeting those who have at least $5 million to invest. Separately, BlackRock Inc is buying Global Infrastructure Partners for $12.5 billion, a major foray into alternative investments. The acquisition will make it the second-largest manager of private infrastructure assets.After blowing past major milestones — the pair now manages over $1 trillion and $10 trillion, respectively — Blackstone and BlackRock need to show investors they still have a good story to tell. The two deals showcase just that.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdNot every dollar earned is deemed equal. In private equity, for instance, being able to fund raise and earn management fees has become more valuable than notching superior fund performance.As private equity groups enter 2024 with record a $2.8 trillion in unsold investments, analysts are brushing away potential gains from asset sales. After all, initial public offering markets remain anemic; so do global M&A activities.HSBC Holdings Plc, for one, calls realised capital gains on portfolio exits “low quality,” while praising the “sticky and hence high quality” nature of fee-related earnings.

The news published on the date January 18, 2024 11:40 AM IST with headline  The US stock market is eating the world. Where is Paris, London? is: 
 Stock markets will increasingly become a precious source of capital. The “Birkenstock spread” might sound like an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction. But it’s one way of seeing how two European footwear companies have performed on the stock market since going public — one in New York, one in London. It should set alarm bells ringing across continental financial hubs, not just the UK.The US clearly has the open-toed edge. Birkenstock Holding Plc has bounced back from one of the worst market debuts in two decades after snubbing its German homeland to list in New York, and is now 8 percent above its initial public offering price. London-listed Dr Martens Plc — whose Anglo-German boots have won over goths, punks and nu-metallers — has slumped some 40 percent over the same period and is well below its IPO price after a November profit warning. These firms derive around 45 percent to 55 percent of sales from the US, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdFashions are fickle, as my colleague Andrea Felsted has noted, but the underlying stock-market trend is not.As more companies opt to list in the US for the promise of a higher price, access to deeper pools of capital and a less risk-averse investor base, Europe limps further behind. American-listed firms make up almost 70 percent of the MSCI World index (which tracks the biggest developed-country companies by market value), whereas a decade ago it was around 50 percent. Sure, this is largely a function of US Big Tech getting bigger, but there are other issues. The UK’s share has shrunk to around 3.9 percent, about half what it was in pre-Brexit times: Trading volumes have slumped in recent years, and leaving the EU has “cannibalised” London’s pool of listings as the euro zone promotes its own hubs and emerging-market firms stay home.The likes of Paris and Frankfurt haven’t made great strides in closing the gap either, with France’s MSCI World share below 4 percent and Amsterdam rising slightly to 1.4 percent. Even as regulators try to promote a more integrated European Union capital market, continental hubs still feel distinctly national. Fading animal spirits and weak economic growth have seen the number of listed firms in Europe fall 17 percent over the past decade, while it’s risen slightly in the US, according to trade association Amafi. Last year’s $14 billion raised by company IPOs on European exchanges was the lowest haul in almost a decade. A lot is riding on this year’s pipeline, from Renault SA unit Ampere to Greece’s largest airport.

The government has extended the policy to allow import of crude soyoil, crude palm oil and crude sunflower oil at lower duty by another year till Mar 31, 2025, the Ministry of Finance said in an official notification late on Monday. The decision aims to keep a check on domestic prices and prevent any further rise in prices of edible oil. In Nov-Dec, India imported palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia, and soyoil from Argentina, Brazil, Iraq and Turkey. Sunflower oil was imported from Argentina, Romania, Russia and Ukraine. "Following this, the demand (for these edible oils) from Malaysia will remain intact," a Jaipur-based trader said.

The Sensex and the Nifty plunged over 2 percent each on January 17 as a fall in banking stocks, triggered by disappointing Q3 show by heavyweight HDFC Bank, led to panic on the Street, undoing the gains brought in by IT firms’ December quarter performance.Analysts expect the selloff to intensify as corporate earnings season moves on and suggest investors to “wait” for the results to get over before putting in fresh money.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove Ad"As the Nifty re-enters 21,700-800 support zones, we see bulls losing control. With Wednesday's selloff being led by banking names, the pressure could further send the Nifty down to 21,400-200 levels," said Ajit Mishra, senior vice president-technical research, Religare Broking.On January 17, the Sensex closed 1,628 points lower, or 2.2 percent, at 71,500, while the Nifty sank 453 points, or 2 percent, to 21,578.Private sector lenders like HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, and ICICI Bank were top Sensex laggards.

 Buy Trade Watchlist Portfolio Message Set Alert livebselivenselive Volume Todays L/H More × Emkay Global Financial's research report on HDFC BankDespite the slower NII growth and contingent provisions (Rs12.2bn) towards AIF investments, HDFCB reported in-line PAT at Rs163.7bn, primarily due to lower tax incidence (write-back of Rs15bn provisions, pursuant to a favorable court order). After sharp fall in 2Q, Bank noted stable NIM at 3.6% (3.4% on assets), which we believe was partly due to absence of the ICRR drag and a better LDR. Though deposit growth was slower in 3Q (+2% QoQ), Bank contends that it would continue to resist bulk deposits unlike other banks, and even mobilize regulatory cost-efficient borrowings in the interim. That said, we believe the Bank needs to accelerate deposit growth, given rising regulatory concerns about higher LDR (+100%) and lower LCR at 110%. This may have some bearing on margins in the near term, but would support structural margin recovery in the long run, as it replaces the high-cost eHDFCL borrowings and thus supports core profitability. On asset quality, Bank remains comfortably placed, while one off-gains from the HDFC Credila stake sale, potentially in 4Q, could help it further shore-up provision buffers.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdOutlookWe cut FY25-26E earnings by 3%, building-in the growth moderation, but retain our long term BUY with TP of Rs2,100/sh (valuing the core bank at 2.8x Dec-25E ABV + subs at Rs192/sh).

Bank saw a oneoff gain from the Fedfina stake sale (Rs0.9-1bn) in 3Q which was partly evened out by the recent wage revision. Going forward, staff cost may remain elevated in 4Q due to impact of the wage revision on retirement liability, while the bank may also take some hit on AIF.

Loan growth at 4.9% QoQ was led by CRB, housing and CC. With system liquidity in shortfall and peak LDR at 77.4%, deposit growth should be faster for current loan momentum to sustain, failing which system loan accretion should reduce in FY25/26E, compressing LDRs. Factoring a 15% CAGR for HDFCB, we trim loan growth by 1% in FY25/26E which would impact NIM by 4/5bps.

Production of oilseeds in the US in 2023-24 was seen higher by 920,000 tn from last month's estimate at 122.37 mln tn, the department said in its monthly report. The higher soybean production forecasts for Argentina, the US, Russia, China, Paraguay, and Bolivia are offset by lower Brazil production. The department has raised the US oilseed forecast due to higher production of soybean, rapeseed, and sunflower seed crops. However, the increase in these three oilseeds was partly offset by lower production of peanuts and cottonseeds. Global ending stocks of oilseed in 2023-24 are pegged at 131.34 mln tn, down 350,000 tn from the estimate in December. The department has projected global soybean output at 399 mln tn, up 100,000 tn from the previous month as abundant early-season rainfall improved prospects of yield in Argentina and Paraguay. Production in Argentina and Paraguay increased by 2 mln tn to 50 mln tn and 300,000 tn to 10.3 mln tn, respectively, according to the report. However, Brazil's production of soybean in 2023-24 was seen lower by 4 mln tn from December at 157 mln tn, the USDA said in the report. "Reduced rainfall in the Center West region and northeastern states lowered yield potential," the report said. Brazil is the world's largest producer of soybean, followed by the US and Argentina. The department has kept the outlook for US soybean production at 113.34 mln tn, up 950,000 tn from the previous month's estimate. In 2023-24, soybean output in Argentina is projected at 50.0 mln tn, up 200,000 tn from last month. "Global soybean exports for 2023-24 have increased 700,000 tn to 170.9 mln tn with higher exports for Paraguay and Russia," said the report. Global ending stocks of soybean in 2023-24 are pegged at 114.6 mln tn, up 400,000 tn from last month's projection on higher stocks for the US and Argentina partly offset by lower Brazilian stocks. The US season-average soybean price forecast (for 2023-24) is unchanged at $12.75 per bushel, down 15 cents from last month, soybean meal price is projected at $380 per short tn, down $10, and soybean oil price is forecast at 54 cents per pound, down 3 cents, the agency said in its report. The US government agency sees global soybean meal output in 2023-24 unchanged as higher exports for Argentina, India, and Bolivia offset lower Brazilian shipments. Soymeal is a derivative of soybean, manufactured by crushing oilseeds, and is mainly used in producing poultry feed.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdFor all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

 commodities Geojit's report on Agri PicksThe US Department of Agriculture has reduced its estimate for global oilseed output for 2023-24 (May-Apr) to 660.18 mln tn, down 810,000 tn from 660.99 mln tn forecast in December. Production of oilseeds in the US in 2023-24 was seen higher by 920,000 tn from last month's estimate at 122.37 mln tn, the department said in its monthly report. The higher soybean production forecasts for Argentina, the US, Russia, China, Paraguay, and Bolivia are offset by lower Brazil production. The department has raised the US oilseed forecast due to higher production of soybean, rapeseed, and sunflower seed crops. However, the increase in these three oilseeds was partly offset by lower production of peanuts and cottonseeds. Global ending stocks of oilseed in 2023-24 are pegged at 131.34 mln tn, down 350,000 tn from the estimate in December. The department has projected global soybean output at 399 mln tn, up 100,000 tn from the previous month as abundant early-season rainfall improved prospects of yield in Argentina and Paraguay. Production in Argentina and Paraguay increased by 2 mln tn to 50 mln tn and 300,000 tn to 10.3 mln tn, respectively, according to the report. However, Brazil's production of soybean in 2023-24 was seen lower by 4 mln tn from December at 157 mln tn, the USDA said in the report. "Reduced rainfall in the Center West region and northeastern states lowered yield potential," the report said. Brazil is the world's largest producer of soybean, followed by the US and Argentina. The department has kept the outlook for US soybean production at 113.34 mln tn, up 950,000 tn from the previous month's estimate. In 2023-24, soybean output in Argentina is projected at 50.0 mln tn, up 200,000 tn from last month. "Global soybean exports for 2023-24 have increased 700,000 tn to 170.9 mln tn with higher exports for Paraguay and Russia," said the report. Global ending stocks of soybean in 2023-24 are pegged at 114.6 mln tn, up 400,000 tn from last month's projection on higher stocks for the US and Argentina partly offset by lower Brazilian stocks. The US season-average soybean price forecast (for 2023-24) is unchanged at $12.75 per bushel, down 15 cents from last month, soybean meal price is projected at $380 per short tn, down $10, and soybean oil price is forecast at 54 cents per pound, down 3 cents, the agency said in its report. The US government agency sees global soybean meal output in 2023-24 unchanged as higher exports for Argentina, India, and Bolivia offset lower Brazilian shipments. Soymeal is a derivative of soybean, manufactured by crushing oilseeds, and is mainly used in producing poultry feed.-Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdFor all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

The news published on the date January 15, 2024 04:50 PM IST with headline  Of Pepsodent & Portfolios: The habit loop in equity investing is: 
 The current market dynamics persistently reinforce the habit loop, and a transformation in this pattern is foreseeable only when the rewards derived from the habit become unfavourable (i.e., negative returns). Until such a shift occurs, investors focusing on “silly things” like fundamental analysis, valuations, and optimal capital allocation may find themselves perplexed by the ongoing trajectory. “I made a million dollars off Pepsodent,” boasted Canadian ad man Claude Hopkins (1866-1932). A million dollars was a lot at the time, but it was his innovative approach that shaped consumer habits and even today, continues to influence marketers across generations. Hopkins propelled Pepsodent to global success through his seminal work in advertising.Initially, when approached by an old friend for the Pepsodent campaign, Hopkins displayed only mild interest. At the time, the deterioration of Americans' dental health was evident, attributed to increased national income and the consumption of sugary, processed foods.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdThe situation reached a critical point during World War I, as decaying teeth were cited as a national security risk. Despite widespread dental issues, the challenge lay in the fact that toothpaste sales were sluggish as people never brushed their teeth, rendering door-to-door sales of tooth powders useless.Also Read: Tata Consumer's acquisitions seem like good buys but its valuation screams 'goodbye'Ultimately, Hopkins accepted the campaign. His strategy was straightforward—he instilled a desire and fuelled the habit loop. As Charles Duhigg notes in his book "The Power of Habit," many decisions that appear rational are, in fact, shaped by ingrained habits.

 Nifty may be in last leg of rally towards 22,400 Trade Watchlist Portfolio Message Set Alert livebselivenselive Volume Todays L/H More × One week into the year 2024, the Indian markets had reached yet another record high. The domestic market ended the week (on January 12) at the historic top as there were no negative factors. Initially, we witnessed a tug of war between bulls and bears for several sessions, but eventually, the bulls were able to confirm a new breakout in the benchmark Nifty index. The index hit a lifetime high of 21,928, ending the week up 0.85 percent.In the previous weekly edition, we said that the index could still rise towards 22,000 and this was resistance formed by the placement of the uptrend line. Thus, Nifty managed to break above the support of 21,500 and tested almost 22,000 in futures. Going forward, the rally above 22,000 could move towards 22,200-22,400 next week.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdHowever, the long-short ratio of FII index futures was around 70 percent in the previous week, but now it is around 66 percent. Over the past 2-3 years, the market briefly peaked when this ratio reached the 70-75 percent range. This suggests that Nifty still has some upside potential, but this could be the final stage of the rally, after which we could see strong profit-taking in the market.Traders are advised to continue to be cautious with long positions. For individual stock opportunities, especially smallcap companies, you should maintain a strict downside stoploss. On the flip-side, the market needs to break 21,500 to confirm the temporary top.The Nifty Bank index once again underperformed the benchmark index and ended the week in the red. The low was 47,000, but it needs to surpass the lifetime high of 48,600. Therefore, only a move up or down the 48,600-47,000 range could determine further trends next week.

The news published on the date January 10, 2024 09:38 AM IST with headline  With ATC deal, Brookfield eyes long-term play in India's digital infra space is: 
 Already, Brookfield’s DIT has a portfolio of roughly 175,000 towers, acquired in 2020 from Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Limited. Brookfield Asset Management-sponsored Data Infrastructure Trust (DIT) is looking to capitalise on the next leg of growth in the towerco space, which will come through with the 5G expansion, through its recently signed deal to acquire ATC India, industry executives and analysts said.Data Infrastructure Trust inked a definitive agreement with the US-based American Tower Corporation on January 4 to acquire 100 percent equity interests in ATC India. The acquisition is expected to diversify DIT’s revenues and increase touchpoints with all mobile network operators in India.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdTower companies, or towercos, in India combine various infrastructure pieces, such as macro sites, small cells, and edge sites to capitalise on the opportunity in the digital infrastructure space and drive growth, similar to players in the US."They seem to be gung-ho about the market. That's why they are ratcheting up the magnitude of investments across various infrastructures. They are at a stage of deploying more capital. This transaction (the ATC deal) indicates that they are doubling down on India's infrastructure opportunity, especially private infrastructure, which will last for decades," Vivekanand S, an analyst at Ambit Capital Research, told Moneycontrol on January 9.“One of the critical rationales was that there would be synergies between Brookfield and ATC India. For anyone to give a reasonable valuation to ATC, it would have been only Brookfield due to the synergies,” said an industry executive on condition of anonymity.Brookfield’s DIT has a portfolio of roughly 175,000 towers, acquired in 2020 from Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Limited. DIT houses Brookfield’s telecom tower businesses in India through Summit Digitel and Crest Digitel.With the $2.5-billion deal, DIT’s tower portfolio has reached around 252,000, compared to Indus Towers’ 204,000 towers.In India, Brookfield has approximately $25 billion in assets under management across infrastructure, real estate, renewable power and transition and private equity.Story continues below AdvertisementBrookfield didn't respond to Moneycontrol's queries.Brookfield’s third acquisition in IndiaATC India is Brookfield’s third acquisition in India’s telecom infrastructure space. In 2022, it acquired a portfolio of 5,000 indoor business solution sites and small cell sites, which helped advance the rollout of 5G, and enabled telecom operators to extend their coverage ambit in difficult-to-access and dense areas.“It is a good structure with two strong tower companies and two strong telecom operators. Brookfield will have a better way of managing all telecom operators. With ATC India’s towers, Brookfield will get higher tenancies as all three telecom operators are the former’s customers,” said another industry analyst working with a leading brokerage.Shiv Putcha, principal analyst at Mandala Insights, said consolidation is much needed in the towerco space as it will lead to more substantial companies. “In this space, you can’t be subscale to make money.”He said Brookfield is not just restricting itself to the macro tower space and is looking at the broader digital space, including data centres.“Our coverage continues to be a growing area. There is an opportunity in the edge computing space as well. Brookfield can look at setting up edge locations as well. It is better to come in now, after the 5G launch. There won't be much on the enterprise side if all these things are not in place, the opportunity is huge,” Putcha said.He said that towerco is a stable, low-growth space, but it will pick up when the second round of network expansion takes place, which will come with 5G advanced deployments by Indian telecom operators.“The 5G will happen in two years from now. Hence, tower companies must look at driving growth from other places, especially in the digital infrastructure space, which includes network services to enterprises," he said, adding that the future network expansion by Vodafone Idea and BSNL could also present an opportunity.In a note, Ambit Capital said that ATC had built its Indian tower portfolio through acquisitions, including those from Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, which account for 25 percent of its towers."With a 14 percent market share of India’s tower industry and a similar share of tenancies, ATC wasn’t able to improve terms of trade with telcos with fair pricing escalation and margins for energy and acquire new customers through data centres and fibre deployment," the brokerage said in the note. "Controlled by telcos, India’s towerco industry couldn’t develop lucrative capital reinvestment avenues. VI’s funding challenges affected ATC India’s cash collections," it said.Ambit Capital added that since Indus has long-term pricing contracts with telcos, the ATC-Brookfield deal won’t enable it to change those terms. "Besides, since 4G and future telco generations entail fibre rollout, where telcos aren’t relying on towercos, we see no improvement in the bargaining power of Indus with customers,“ it said

After receiving all necessary regulatory approvals, this breakdown can be a setback to both Sony and Zee, having both reported subpar growth over the last year. We believe the merger not going through will be a lose-lose for both parties, particularly in the face of competition with a much larger entity of Reliance-Disney (if the merger goes through).

The Nifty would likely halt its fall at support levels and consolidate before resuming next leg of the upmove, Gedia said.

 - Dear Reader,The big question in the forthcoming interim Budget is: Will it be a pre-election one, replete with sops? At first glance, there appears to be little need for handouts, what with real GDP growth widely expected to be around 7 percent for the next few years. Corporate and bank balance sheets are in fine shape and investment demand is powering the economy. Bank credit is growing robustly. The stock markets are scaling new highs. Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdIt’s true that the pre-election interim Budget of 2019 was a populist one, as we pointed out here. But then, real GDP growth in 2023-24 is estimated at 7.3 percent while it was 6.5 percent in 2018-19. Surely, the economy can now do without new sops?But look under the hood and a rather different picture emerges. First and foremost, as the IMF’s Fiscal Monitor points out, the overall deficit of the Centre and the states is estimated to be 8.8 percent of GDP in 2023-24, compared to 6.4 percent in 2018-19. And the gross debt of the Centre and the states is estimated at 81.9 percent of GDP in 2023-24, against 70.4 percent of GDP in 2018-19. What’s more, the central government has promised to prune its fiscal deficit down to 4.5 percent of GDP by 2025-26, from the current fiscal year’s estimate of 5.9 percent. Hence, the need for substantial fiscal consolidation. That’s why IndusInd Bank chief economist Gaurav Kapur wrote here: “The Budget should thus focus on strengthening the long-term growth impulses provided by public investments, building fiscal buffers to counter future shocks, and putting public debt on a downward path to free up space for productive spending.”But there’s a catch. Consumption growth, the GDP estimates show, will be the lowest in many years in the current fiscal year. Growth in the farm sector is estimated to be a mere 1.8 percent year-on-year. Average real rural wages for men in November, the latest month for which data are available from the Labour Bureau, show y-o-y growth of a piffling 0.2 percent. Rural food inflation, which was 0.2 percent in 2018-19, was at 8.97 percent in December 2023.

 AmEx expects revenues this year will climb between 9% and 11%, and it believes earnings per share will be between $12.65 and $13.15 per share. American Express’ fourth quarter profits jumped 23% from last year as more cardmembers kept a running balance on their accounts compared with previous years, meaning more interest income for the credit card issuer.But a considerable rise in maintained balances "up 17% from last year" as well as rise in delinquencies and credit losses, can raise questions about the financial health of AmEx cardmembers who are typically more financially stable and more likely to pay off balances by the end of each month.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdThe New York company posted a profit of $1.93 billion, or $2.62 a share. That’s up from a profit $1.57 billion, or $2.07 a share, in the same period a year earlier.

The credit card company historically makes the bulk of its revenue from the fees it collects from merchants who accept American Express cards as a form of payment. Spending on card accounts slowed as well, with the average cardmember spending about 2% more on their card from a year ago.Profits this quarter were driven in part by interest-accruing accounts cardmembers who aren’t paying off their balances in full. AmEx pivoted away from the charge card business model before the COVID-19 pandemic to a model that encouraged customers to keep a balance. That push has been largely successful, which means AmEx collects interest from accounts where historically it had not.AmEx had $126 billion in cardmember loans at the end of 2023, up 17% from last year. That resulted in AmEx bringing in $4.91 billion in interest revenue last quarter, up from $3.62 billion a year earlier.However, the push to allow cardmembers to keep a balance has led to an increasing number of credit card accounts going delinquent.

 Indonesia's citizens get ready to elect their next president on February 14, and the video in question is intended to "remind people of their responsibility to make the right decisions" (Bloomberg Opinion) -- As deepfakes go, it’s not a great one. Even so, the viral video of Indonesia’s former president and dictator Suharto that was created using artificial intelligence took the world’s most populous Muslim nation by storm. It racked up millions of views on social media, and prompted hand-wringing about the dangers of using this kind of technology.“I am President Suharto, the second president of Indonesia, inviting you to elect representatives of the people from Golkar,” the figure in the video says. The man behind it, Erwin Aksa, is a member of Golkar, the political party the former leader presided over for the 32 years he was in power. It is the nation’s oldest operating party, stemming from the New Order era, one of the most corrupt dictatorships in Southeast Asia’s history. The party was hugely powerful and influential, and all government employees were expected to vote for it.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdTurns out running a country is pretty easy, when you control everything. Golkar hasn’t had that kind of power since Suharto fell amid the unrest that engulfed the archipelago in 1998. But as citizens get ready to elect their next president on Feb. 14, Aksa said on Instagram that the video was intended to remind people of their responsibility to make the right decisions.Suharto’s appeal, despite his authoritarianism, is not new. During the 2014 elections, I travelled to his hometown in Kemusuk in Central Java, as millions prepared to directly elect only their third president since the transition from dictatorship to democracy began. It was hard to miss the love that many still have for the man they affectionately call “the father of the nation.” At the time, T-shirts featuring his face were being sold, with slogans in Javanese saying: “It was better in my time, wasn’t it?”This desire for a return to perceived stability is not unusual, but it is worrying given Indonesia’s importance in regional power dynamics. It’s the world’s most populous Muslim country, and Southeast Asia’s largest economy. It is a critical partner for the US in its ambitions to curtail China’s rise, and is also a valuable modern Muslim ally. A creep toward authoritarianism, however small, must be avoided at all cost.

 Although Vietnam's current output is a tiny percentage of global supply, the nation is sitting on around 17% of known reserves, second only to China (Bloomberg Opinion) -- Vietnam’s hopes of becoming a production hub to rival China are showing momentum. A big boost will come as the nation leans into its untapped reserves of rare earths, even as it struggles to find traction in new sectors such as electric vehicles.Over the past decade, the country has built a beachhead in manufacturing, ranging from cars to electronics. Computers and accessories are now the largest export, surpassing textiles and footwear. The expansion of foreign assemblers like Foxconn Technology Group, GoerTek Inc. and Luxshare Precision Industry Co. mean that Apple Inc. products like Macs and AirPods are made locally. While that energy has spurred the birth of other businesses, some have stumbled. Electric-vehicle maker VinFast Auto Ltd., for example, last week posted full-year shipments that missed its own forecast by more than 20%.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdAlthough Apple now has 25 supplier sites in Vietnam, that still pales in comparison to 151 for China and 41 in Taiwan. A key reason is the high concentration of component manufacturers in China. The transfer out of China into India, Vietnam, and Mexico has largely revolved around the final stage of the process when devices are put together like Lego. There’s been very little movement at the other end of the supply chain, where parts like chips, magnets, and diodes are produced.Rare earth minerals are uncommon — though the moniker “rare” is debated — yet crucial to modern industry. Many have unique electrical and magnetic properties that make them useful in electronics, EVs, medical equipment and lasers.Vietnam’s abundance of these ores is catching the attention of its government as well as foreign leaders. Its own hopes for the sector are bold. From just 400 tons of rare-earth-oxides produced in 2021, output shot up to 4,300 tons in 2022. That’s just 1.4% of global supply, and far behind the 210,000 tons from China, according to estimate by the US Geological Survey. In July, Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha approved plans to supercharge expansion, aiming to process as much as 62,500 tons of rare-earth minerals by 2030.

 Unified Payments Interface is used by 300 million Indians to instantly settle bills.

Bankers speak with awe of the industry’s phenomenal expansion, which is so fast-paced that the regulator is starting to get concerned. Fintech players like to draw attention to its lopsided distribution. The industry keeps chasing a fraction of affluent urban professionals to the exclusion of everyone else. Broaden access, they say, and the scorching growth may become more sustainable.For lenders, however, the problem with adding new borrowers is the incremental cost.

It’s a small number for a country of 1.4 billion people, but double from five years ago, underscoring significant expansion. And yet, it’s the same group of 40 million well-heeled Indians who keep getting more cards. Fewer than 13% of Indians over 15 years of age borrow from formal sources, including credit cards. In China, the number is nearly 40%, thanks to a multiyear boom in digital lending before a regulatory crackdown on Ant Group Co. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., the two major players.During the pandemic, India saw an invasion of sorts by predatory Chinese lending apps, but the regulators have chased them away. Out of more than 60 banks in India, about 75% of the entire credit-card franchise by value is with just four — HDFC Bank Ltd., State Bank of India, ICICI Bank Ltd., and Axis Bank Ltd. The reason more lenders aren’t interested in getting into the business or expanding it is that the cost of acquiring and servicing customers works out to about 6,000 rupees ($70) per client, including specialized software for collection and risk management. It isn’t possible to recoup this expense from the spending of someone earning, say, 40,000 rupees a month, middle of the range for what an outsourcing company typically pays fresh coding talent.But what if there was a way? Not with expensive credit-card architecture, but by employing India’s ubiquitous smartphone-based payment protocol that logged more than 100 billion transactions last year.

Direct taxes comprising corporate tax and income tax were estimated at Rs 18.24 lakh crore for FY24.According to Emkay Research, buoyancy in tax receipts in the current financial year, led more by direct taxes, is likely to result in gross tax collections exceeding the FY24 budget estimate by nearly Rs 55,000 crore.Almost 61 percent of the gross tax collection target for FY24 was met in the first eight months, one of the strongest in years.On indirect taxes, Emkay said the average monthly GST collection rate in FY24 has been healthy.

The news published on the date January 25, 2024 07:30 AM IST with headline  Is this the right time to rebalance your portfolio? is: 
 A balanced portfolio can potentially deliver better risk-adjusted returns, ensuring smoother sailing towards your financial destination. In 2023, Indian equity markets were the clear winner. The Nifty 100 index gave a return of around 18 percent, but mid-cap and small-cap indices gave returns of around 38 and 42 percent, respectively. On January 23, the S&P BSE Sensex tumbled by 1,000 points, or 1.47 percent. That's just a single day's fall. All these sharp movements, especially when markets rise the way they did in 2023, warrant a review, maybe rebalancing and shifting your asset allocation back to what is necessitated by your risk profiling and financial goals. Then, on days like January 23, when equity markets fall, your portfolio falls sharply. So, is it time to consider rebalancing your portfolio?Why rebalancing matters: Safeguarding your financial journeyStory continues below AdvertisementRemove AdRebalancing goes beyond mere adjustments in percentages; it's akin to recalibrating your financial compass. Here's why it's a crucial practice:Maintaining your risk compassAsset allocation is not a random number; it mirrors your unique risk tolerance. It draws the line between thrilling adventures and sleepless nights. A skewed portfolio tosses that line overboard, potentially exposing you to more risk than you bargained for. Rebalancing acts as a gentle tug back towards calmer waters, ensuring you stay true to your risk appetite and comfort level. It helps you reach your financial goals without unnecessary white-knuckle moments.

Trade Watchlist Portfolio Message Set Alert livebselivenselive Volume Todays L/H More × Tata Steel Ltd is expected to see a sequential dip in net profit for the December 2023 quarter, primarily attributed to challenges in European operations, according to analysts.

In the December 2022 quarter, the company reported a loss of around Rs 2384 crore.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdConsolidated revenue for the quarter is pegged at Rs 56,400.50 crore, with a 1.3 percent on-quarter increase driven by higher sales realisation in Indian operations and increased sales volume in India. However, this is partially offset by lower sales volume and realisation in Europe. Year-on-year (YoY) revenue is likely to decline by 1.2 percent.Analysts foresee a 3.5 percent QoQ decline in EBITDA, driven by reduced EBITDA per tonne in India due to higher coking coal costs. Despite increased realisation and sales volume in India, this impact outweighs the gains. In Europe, weaker EBITDA per tonne is expected due to lower sales volume and realisation, partially offset by reduced coking coal costs. Additionally, analysts anticipate a sequential drop in EBITDA per tonne in Europe due to lower sales volume and operating leverage.Analysts further predict a 2 percent growth in standalone volumes for the third quarter, reaching 4.9 million tonnes. They anticipate an increase of around Rs 1,200 per tonne in realisations and expect the standalone EBITDA per tonne to rise around 10 percent to Rs 14,700. However higher costs are likely to partially offset the realisation gains. Given that Tata Steel has captive iron ore, the company would not be impacted from higher ore prices leading to margin expansion sequentially, analysts said. Corus EBITDA per tonne is expected to be negative, at $177.

He believes if any of the unsecured lending done as of today starts to unravel, fintechs and the lower-rated NBFCs will see the maximum impact. Edited excerpts. (Read part 1 here.)Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdApart from the boom in unsecured lending and personal loans, what have been the other big triggers for the banking industry in the past year? Going ahead, what will be the new triggers?I think retail and secured mortgages will continue to be the mainstay of the banking system. Now, unsecured loan growth is expected to come down over the next 12 to 18 months, because that's what the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) wants. Banks’ exposure to NBFCs will also come down. This will be offset by mortgages, which will still be decent, steady, and healthy. SME lending will also pick up, and private sector banks have been gaining market share in this segment. And we are hoping that private sector capex picks up a little bit. Right now, we are in election mode. Maybe post-elections, in the second half of FY25, some extra pick-up can happen in the capacity utilisation level, which currently stands at 80 percent. So, in our view, that's where the opportunity is.And I should emphasise that corporate lending will not pick up in a big way because the capex cycle takes time to flow through. First come the sanctions, and then disbursements happen in stages, depending on the project execution phases. So, it will not be a big immediate trigger. But it will pick up gradually over the next two years.

Latha Venkatesh, executive editor, CNBC-TV18 in her column with Moneycontrol Pro argues whether the worst is behind the stock, or, more importantly, will it regain its lost glory?But it is not just the earnings, which are a reflection of the past quarter, that tripped markets. There is a clear change in the global macroeconomic narrative beginning with the US Federal Reserve’s ability to pivot on rates.

 Stock markets will increasingly become a precious source of capital. The “Birkenstock spread” might sound like an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction. But it’s one way of seeing how two European footwear companies have performed on the stock market since going public — one in New York, one in London. It should set alarm bells ringing across continental financial hubs, not just the UK.The US clearly has the open-toed edge. Birkenstock Holding Plc has bounced back from one of the worst market debuts in two decades after snubbing its German homeland to list in New York, and is now 8 percent above its initial public offering price. London-listed Dr Martens Plc — whose Anglo-German boots have won over goths, punks and nu-metallers — has slumped some 40 percent over the same period and is well below its IPO price after a November profit warning. These firms derive around 45 percent to 55 percent of sales from the US, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdFashions are fickle, as my colleague Andrea Felsted has noted, but the underlying stock-market trend is not.As more companies opt to list in the US for the promise of a higher price, access to deeper pools of capital and a less risk-averse investor base, Europe limps further behind. American-listed firms make up almost 70 percent of the MSCI World index (which tracks the biggest developed-country companies by market value), whereas a decade ago it was around 50 percent. Sure, this is largely a function of US Big Tech getting bigger, but there are other issues. The UK’s share has shrunk to around 3.9 percent, about half what it was in pre-Brexit times: Trading volumes have slumped in recent years, and leaving the EU has “cannibalised” London’s pool of listings as the euro zone promotes its own hubs and emerging-market firms stay home.The likes of Paris and Frankfurt haven’t made great strides in closing the gap either, with France’s MSCI World share below 4 percent and Amsterdam rising slightly to 1.4 percent. Even as regulators try to promote a more integrated European Union capital market, continental hubs still feel distinctly national. Fading animal spirits and weak economic growth have seen the number of listed firms in Europe fall 17 percent over the past decade, while it’s risen slightly in the US, according to trade association Amafi. Last year’s $14 billion raised by company IPOs on European exchanges was the lowest haul in almost a decade. A lot is riding on this year’s pipeline, from Renault SA unit Ampere to Greece’s largest airport.

The news published on the date January 17, 2024 09:35 AM IST with headline  ChatGPT may rival Flash Boys in transforming markets is: 
 In the last half-century other trading innovations have had similarly broad effects. (Source: Bloomberg) Large language models, such as ChatGPT, are threatening to disrupt most areas of life and work. Financial trading is no exception. The potential for LLMs to understand markets rather than just recognise patterns sets them apart from earlier versions of machine learning and artificial intelligence that have failed to achieve much notable trading success.The basic problem is that financial prices are nearly all noise, they are very close to random walks. Lots of smart people and algorithms conspire to eliminate any signal that can be used for profit. It’s like trying to understand text that is deliberately written to be misleading. Traditional AI is more successful when signals are stronger relative to noise.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdBefore we get deeper into what sets modern LLMs apart, let me lay out why you should care, even if you have no interest in computerised financial trading. Trading is the foundation of finance and even small changes in mechanisms exert profound effects on the market, which translate into profound economic consequences.High-frequency trading, introduced in the late 1990s, didn’t just link end-buyers and end-sellers more quickly and efficiently. It vastly increased trading volumes, lowered transaction costs, and knocked humans out of the equity-trading business — a transformation Michael Lewis explored in Flash Boys. It led to zero-commission brokerages and zero-fee index funds — eliminating the revenues that brokers and asset managers had relied upon since they were created. It required a fundamental re-engineering of financial regulation. But HFT didn’t just restructure two major financial businesses, challenge regulators and cut costs to end-investors, it gave us new phenomena like flash crashes.In the last half-century other trading innovations have had similarly broad effects. The introduction of public futures and options traded on financial instruments in 1973 created the modern global derivatives economy, which vastly expanded leverage outside the banking system and made it difficult for regulators to monitor or control.

The news published on the date January 16, 2024 09:39 AM IST with headline  India’s stock and bond markets are turning into an inexorable force is: 
 Global investors are so confident in corporate India that they are paying 82 percent more for its shares. Anyone wondering whether the India juggernaut is sustainable will find the answer in bonds, which have a penchant for discerning the way of the world and telling every other market what to do.At least $1 trillion of government securities traded daily in the most populous nation and biggest democracy is poised to become the darling of international investors when India this year joins the benchmark for emerging-market debt compiled by JPMorgan Chase & Co. India's entry following Russia’s exclusion after Vladimir Putin's 2022 invasion of Ukraine (and 2014 seizure of Crimea) and when China's sovereign debt is losing its luster, will make Asia's third-largest economy a beneficiary of as much as $40 billion of inflows during the next 18 months, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. How big a deal is that? Consider that foreigners, who are currently prohibited from owning more than 6 percent of India's sovereign debt, held as little as 0.4 percent last March, paltry by any measure of major developing countries.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdOverseas investors will still have to contend with government policies that benefit from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, especially the purchase of Russian oil at discounted prices. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government also is leading the expansion of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), who are committed to countering Western influence, curbing domestic dissent from the press and political opponents, and creating an alternative financial system that is less dependent on the US dollar.But the prospects for rising demand for India’s debt couldn't come at more propitious moment for the world's No. 5 economy, whose gross domestic product rose 7.6 percent in the three months to September from a year ago, more than any of the economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg and much greater than the Reserve Bank of India’s projected 6.5 percent. The robust GDP report means India continues to be the fastest-growing major economy, with Modi's government increasing investment in infrastructure and providing subsidies for companies willing to build new plants across the country. “The sharp upside surprise to the GDP figures is a welcome sign especially as it comes in the backdrop of a broad-based pickup across most non-agricultural sectors,” Upasna Bhardwaj, an economist with Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd, told Bloomberg News at the end of November.In 2022 and for the first time in three decades, India was no longer a perennial laggard compared to China, with gross domestic product expanding $266 billion, almost twice the $143 billion increase for its Asian neighbour. India’s economy is anticipated to outpace China for at least the next seven quarters, according to 40 economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg. India also is outperforming Japan and Germany, the third- and fourth-largest economies, to the extent that it will surpass Japan (almost $5 trillion of GDP) by 2027, Michael Patra, the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India predicted in October 2022.

 IT stocks report better than feared Q3 earnings Shares of information technology companies have been on a roll after the big names sprang a positive surprise in the third quarter. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), HCL Tech and Wipro topped margins estimates despite the seasonality factor. With a 6 percent quarterly growth in constant currency revenues, HCL Tech managed to outshine its peers.For the sector as a whole, healthy deal wins and a drop in the employee attrition rate were the other highlights of the quarter. Management commentaries further contributed to the optimistic outlook, with TCS suggesting a potential turnaround in the BFSI or banking, financial services and insurance segment and anticipated growth in the upcoming quarter. Wipro's leadership has also signalled green shoots in discretionary demand.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdBut what does the pecking order look like following the better-than-expected quarterly showing? In an interview with Moneycontrol, Apurva Prasad, vice president, institutional research, HDFC Securities, says he prefers tech bellwether TCS over Infosys as it is poised to continue its outperformance in the coming quarters. Edited excerpts:The big four have reported their numbers. The trend has been set as Q3 earnings have beaten muted expectations. So looking at the top four, which one is emerging //emerged// as a clear winner in Q3? Would you say it's HCL Tech given the fact that it has reported industry-beating revenue growth?Yes, we were expecting HCL Tech to outperform in the quarter and they seem to have done that, but in the services space the outperformance is not very significant. But in any case, it sets up the company for an outperformance in FY24 and this outperformance should also likely continue in FY25. So HCL Tech, I would say, would be the best out of the top four.
